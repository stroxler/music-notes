The website
[here](https://www.goldstandardsonglist.com/Pages_Sort_1a/Sort_1a_Blues.htm)
has a pretty impressive list of tunes across generes.

A lot of the (current) pop I like most these days is loosely
categorized as "Indie Folk", and there are places like the "Indie
Folk Central" youtube channel where you can find recent tunes
aggregated.
