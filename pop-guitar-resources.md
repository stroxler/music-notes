### Country and Bluegrass

- [Complete Country Guitar](https://sfpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S93C3299579)
  - `SCORE 787.6 So39m 2016`
  - Had in my opinion a pretty good intro to a variety of basic
    styles including Carter bass, Carter melody, and Travis
    picking. Not a ton of lead guitar soloing though.
- [School of Bluegrass Guitar](https://sfpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S93C2512844)
  - `SCORE 787.6 C2305s`
  - Supposedly has both Carter and fiddle-style arrangements
    of a number of tunes
- [School of Country Guitar](https://sfpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S93C2369934)
  - `SCORE 787.6 C2305m`
  - Supposedly has a solid set of "hot-lick" style ideas for solo
    lead guitar.

### More general pop guitar

- [One Man Guitar Jam](https://sfpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S93C2906817)
  - `SCORE 787.6 N3377o`
  - Focused on how to interweave lead solos with rhythm guitar; this
    is *exactly* what I need if I really want to be able to play
    lead while performing alone.
  - It's aggressively cross-genre, includes specific chapters on
    swing-style jazz standards and country for example.

- [Traditional and Contemporary Fingerpicking Styles for Guitar](https://sfpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S93C2629829)
  - `SCORE 787.6 T6938t 2005`
  - This was a pretty good book, covered a fairly wide variety of
    older fingerpicking styles.

### Ragtime guitar
