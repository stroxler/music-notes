### Country and Bluegrass

- [Complete Country Guitar](https://sfpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S93C3299579)
  - `SCORE 787.6 So39m 2016`
  - Had in my opinion a pretty good intro to a variety of basic
    styles including Carter bass, Carter melody, and Travis
    picking. Not a ton of lead guitar soloing though.
- [School of Bluegrass Guitar](https://sfpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S93C2512844)
  - `SCORE 787.6 C2305s`
  - Supposedly has both Carter and fiddle-style arrangements
    of a number of tunes
- [School of Country Guitar](https://sfpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S93C2369934)
  - `SCORE 787.6 C2305m`
  - Supposedly has a solid set of "hot-lick" style ideas for solo
    lead guitar.

### More general pop guitar

- [One Man Guitar Jam](https://sfpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S93C2906817)
  - `SCORE 787.6 N3377o`
  - Focused on how to interweave lead solos with rhythm guitar; this
    is *exactly* what I need if I really want to be able to play
    lead while performing alone.
  - It's aggressively cross-genre, includes specific chapters on
    swing-style jazz standards and country for example.

- [Traditional and Contemporary Fingerpicking Styles for Guitar](https://sfpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S93C2629829)
  - `SCORE 787.6 T6938t 2005`
  - This was a pretty good book, covered a fairly wide variety of
    older fingerpicking styles.

### Ragtime guitar

- [Blind Blake (S Gross early masters)](https://sfpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S93C2078501)
  - `SCORE 784.7 B619s 2007`
  - Without a doubt Blind Blake is the most important pop ragtime
    player. His style may be tricky to learn, he did some unusual
    things with his thumb technique.
- [Classic Ragtime Guitar](https://sfpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S93C2629823)
  - `https://sfpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S93C2629823`
  - Honestly this wasn't a big hit for me, but I did really like
    both the Maple Leaf and Silver Swan arrangements.
- [The John Pearse Album of Ragtime Guitar Solos](https://sfpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S93C5765896)
  - `SCORE 787.61 P316j`
  - I haven't yet checked this one out, it's on my list of books to
    look at
- [The Complete Works of Scott Joplin](https://sfpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S93C2728868)
  - `SCORE 787.61 J747c`
  - Most of these are in reasonable tunings (tons of drop D if I recall).
    If I were to actually learn a big chunk of them, I'd have an entire
    set of ragtime which could be useful for background music gigs!
