# Rotating keys

The most important basic drill is rotating major key changes,
focusing mainly on V-I and II-V-I but also throwing in
other variations (longer chains, diminished passing chords,
and/or substitutions).

This drill serves a few purposes:
- Drilling the connections between keys, which is an incredible tool for
  standards because tracking modulation is the best way of breaking standards
  into "big" chunks that are easy to memorize, and is also critical for
  memorizing in a key-agnostic way.
- Getting across the flat-to-sharp boundary reliably with minimal mental
  effort.
- Locking common patterns in across all keys so the chords are trivial to
  identify (even when sight reading) and at your fingertips, even when keys are
  changing.

## Keys to rotate, in a rough order of importance

In square brackets I have the number of cycles needed to cover all
keys.

- Up a 4th [1]
- Up a minor 3rd (note the connection to backdoor II-V sub) [3]
- Down a minor 3rd (note the connection to "sidedoor" II-V sub) [3]

- Down a whole step [2]
- Up a 5th [1]
- Up a whole step (note the connection to III-VI-II-V)

- Down a half step (note the connection to tritone sub)
- Up a half step (note the connection to tritone sub to V)

- Up a major 3rd (note the natural tritone / chromatic movement) [4]
- Down a major 3rd [4]

- Tritone; this is pretty rare and and is a cycle of just 2, it's
  worth practicing for completeness and because drilling it will
  likely help with tritone substitutions.


## Progressions to rotate, in a rough order of importance

- II-V-I and V-I (including Vsus-I)
- VI-II-V-I and III-IV-II-V-I
  - note that many people think of III-VI-II as a stand-alone
    II-V, but it's useful to think of it both ways for memorization.
- parallel minor II(b5)-V(altered)
- tritone sub II-V-I and V-I
- Vma7-V7-I + the tritone sub version ("flipped suspension")
- IV-V-I and VI-IV-V-I ... not so common in jazz, but very in pop!
- backdoor sub II-V-I, and VI-II-V-I (is actually easier!)
- diminished passing variations:
  - ascending into the II, V, or I
    - this can come from nowhere since it's really a dom inversion
    - but it's frequently combined with whole step below, e.g. in a
      IV-V-I insert #IVdim, or in a backdoor bVII-I insert a VIIdim
  - descending into the II, V, or I (but mainly II or V!)
    - usually this would be preceded by a minor, and the dim
      chord is sort of like a V sub (e.g. Em-Ebdim-Dm); the bass is
      just like a tritone sub but the chord is very different
    - it's worth practicing out of nowhere too though, in particular
      a bIIIdim into a II - quite a few standards do this (2 examples:
      "All of Me" and "Body and Soul")

- combo tritone sub / chromatic repetition changes
  ...note often these are actually offset rather than direct
     circle of 5th movements
  - blues for alice = chromatic repetition (III-VI-bIII-bIV-II-V)
  - satin doll = (IVm-II7-bVIm-bII7)

## Sepecific tune-derived changes to drill

All the Things You Are transitions:gg
 - Up a major 3rd by way of IV in the old key to either II or V
 - Up a minor 3rd by way of a VI-II-V (note backdoor relation!)
 - Down a major 3rd by way of II(maybe b5)-V (early end of bridge)
 - Up a major 3rd by way of a minor V-I into VIm (late end of bridge)

Satin Doll changes:
 - Cycling the II-V twice is pretty common, can mix that into any drill
 - The offset tritone sub (VIm-II7-bVIm-bII7) is distinctive

The Way You Look Tonight
 - end of A: V7-Vm7-I7 into IV, then jump to II (i.e. 6 of 4) into a V-I
 - start of B: vanilla II-V-I up a minor 3rd
 - end of B: a minor 3rd down via a II-V, some arrangements insert
   changes before the II-V but it varies.

When I fall in Love:
 - 2nd phrase: dominant + chromatic cycle: IV7-bVII7-VI7 into a II-V
   (often insert a tt sub for 2nd half of the II for ++chromaticism)


"Cedar Walton changes": ttV-I repeated, descending a whole step at
a time. This cycle can be chained for a while and/or mixed with some
other interval at some point.
