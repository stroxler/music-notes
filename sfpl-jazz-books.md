# Bass Books

- Ed Friedland - Building Walking Bass Lines 787.64
  - great book for breaking down some mechanical technical strategies, I love it
- The Evolving Bassist - Reid 787.4
  - seems to be the #1 recommended method book, looks very good. It's big
- The Latin Bass Book
  - looks awesome, I just don't have the time for it right now
- Ray Brown's Bass Method 787.4
  - mostly technical drills, probably valuable for mastering the instrument

# Guitar Books

- The Brazilian Guitar Book by Faria, 787.6
  - Looks very good (Scher books usually are!):

# Piano and "general" Books

There are *tons* of repertoire books. But focusing just on some core beginner options:

- The Rhythm Book by Rory Stuart looks very good, 781.2

- The Jazz Theory Book by Mark Levine
  - I haven't looked but it's supposed to be pretty comprehensive
- The Jazz Singer's Guidebook by Berkman 784.9
  - Not even a piano book but the first chapter is pretty solid
  - Also a *super* valuable book on ear training techniques
- The Jazz Musician's Guide to Creative Practicing by Berkman 781.65
  - I haven't looked at it much yet but his other book is awesome
