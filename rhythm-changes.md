# Examples of rhythm changes "A" sections

## Simplified changes

The simplest progression, which Jens Larsen outlines in his
original [Rhythm Changes, Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT-K4Y9uxnw)
is actually only one chord per bar. In C:
```
| C  | G7         | C | G7 |
| C7 | F*         | C | G7 |
```
where Jens Larsen has `Fma7` for the F* but I think it's just as easy to use
F7, or F6/9 if you want to be more ambiguous, or even Fm7 / Fm6 for a little
bit of a twist.

In a related [video from The Jazz Guitar Scrapbook channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOiYETWa11E)
the author passes along a Barry Harris note that for most of
his career Charlie Parker focused mainly on the simplified
changes:
```
| C6    | Dm  G7   | C6     | Dm   G7 |
| Gm C7 | F7       | C6     | Dm   G7 |
```
Here the changes do come faster, but:
- it affects the melodies you'd pick, and if you look at Parker's
  heads many of them skip A7 sound that is often used but not here
  - (but those melodies will still work fine if an A7 is comp'ed)
- there's still less movement to worry about than in "typical"
  rhythm changes, with half the measures only involving one chord


## Common changes

You can kind of mix and match things, but probably the
the absolute most common changes for the first `A` section are
```
| C   A7  | Dm  G7  |  C  A7  | Dm  G7 |
| Gm  C7  | Fma F#o |  C/G    | Dm  G7 |
```
with several variations possible in the last 2 bars when
headed into B, the most obvious few options probably being
```
... | C/G  G7  |  C       |
... | C/G  Dm  |  G7  C   |
... | C/G  G7  |  C7  F7  |    (note that F7 leads into E7)
... | C/G  C7  |  F7  Bb7 |    (note that Bb7 leads into Bm)
```

### Typical twists on common variations in the 1st 4 bars

Other than the options above where we skip one or both A7s, the most common two
variations on the first 4 bars are:
- Playing a C#o in place of A7, but that's really the same chord
- Replacing the first G7 with Ebo, which really is different; it's
  a diminished passing chord into Em (which can also be thought
  of as built off of B7, so resoving into Em as a tonic I instead
  of as a tonic III).

### Typical twists on common variations in the 2nd 4 bars

The variations tend ot diverge more here.

It's very common for bar 5 to be `Cma7  C7` or `C6  C7` instead
of `Gm C7`; either one will work well with bars 4 and 6 although
they can produce pretty different sounds for 2 beats.

It's also common to play something different on bar 6, which
can influence where you wind up on bar 7. For example, when
not going to B you can play
```
| ...  | Fma Fmi | Em  A7 | Dm G7 |
```
to end in a 3-6-2-5, and if doing that it's pretty natural to use
```
| ...  | Fma */Eb | Dm  G7 | C    |
```
to get to the B section, where `*` can be either Ebdim = F#dim
or an Fm7.

But I think it's also common to go `F7  Bb` in bar 6 (the "Jazz Guitar
Scrapbook" video above suggests this as a starting point for simplifications)
and that will pretty naturally lead into:
- Am, Em, or C (all of them acting as tonic in backdoor dominant)
- A7, in which case it's tritone sub style dominant shift
  - You could play A7 a full bar then Dm G7 for 1st / 3rd A
  - When heading into B, play A7, Dm, G7, C for 2 beats each

## What about the B section?

Most of these videos focus on the "A" section; in the "B" section
it's usually a bit easier to follow the chords, and the most
common additional techniques are:
- emphasizing the root on bars 1&2 and 5&6 (the 3 and 2 of the
  overall key); this is something both the original I've Got Rhythm
  melody and Ben Webster's often-imitated "secondary head" on
  Cotton Tail do, I think it's become a pretty standard vocabulary,
  especially when doodling over a head that has no B section melody.
- explicitly playing a minor for a bar before the major, to add
  some more implied harmony to the lines
- playing a little outside, for example by using the extra time to do some
  side-stepping or by using tritone substitutions / altered scales
  to get some more interesting "modal interchange" type tension.
