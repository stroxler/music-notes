# Examples of rhythm changes "A" sections

## Simplified changes

The simplest progression, which Jens Larsen outlines in his
original [Rhythm Changes, Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT-K4Y9uxnw)
is actually only one chord per bar. In C:
```
| C  | G7         | C | G7 |
| C7 | F*         | C | G7 |
```
where Jens Larsen has `Fma7` for the F* but I think it's just as easy to use
F7, or F6/9 if you want to be more ambiguous, or even Fm7 / Fm6 for a little
bit of a twist.

In a related [video from The Jazz Guitar Scrapbook channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOiYETWa11E)
the author passes along a Barry Harris note that for most of
his career Charlie Parker focused mainly on the simplified
changes:
```
| C6    | Dm  G7   | C6     | Dm   G7 |
| Gm C7 | F7       | C6     | Dm   G7 |
```
Here the changes do come faster, but:
- it affects the melodies you'd pick, and if you look at Parker's
  heads many of them skip A7 sound that is often used but not here
  - (but those melodies will still work fine if an A7 is comp'ed)
- there's still less movement to worry about than in "typical"
  rhythm changes, with half the measures only involving one chord


## Common changes

You can kind of mix and match things, but probably the
the absolute most common changes for the first `A` section are
```
| C   A7  | Dm  G7  |  C  A7  | Dm  G7 |
| Gm  C7  | Fma F#o |  C/G    | Dm  G7 |
```
with several variations possible in the last 2 bars when
headed into B, the most obvious few options probably being
```
... | C/G  G7  |  C       |
... | C/G  Dm  |  G7  C   |
... | C/G  G7  |  C7  F7  |    (note that F7 leads into E7)
... | C/G  C7  |  F7  Bb7 |    (note that Bb7 leads into Bm)
```

### Typical twists on common variations in the 1st 4 bars

Other than the options above where we skip one or both A7s, the most common two
variations on the first 4 bars are:
- Playing a C#o in place of A7, but that's really the same chord
- Replacing the first G7 with Ebo, which really is different; it's
  a diminished passing chord into Em (which can also be thought
  of as built off of B7, so resoving into Em as a tonic I instead
  of as a tonic III).

### Typical twists on common variations in the 2nd 4 bars

The variations tend ot diverge more here.

It's very common for bar 5 to be `Cma7  C7` or `C6  C7` instead
of `Gm C7`; either one will work well with bars 4 and 6 although
they can produce pretty different sounds for 2 beats.

It's also common to play something different on bar 6, which
can influence where you wind up on bar 7. For example, when
not going to B you can play
```
| ...  | Fma Fmi | Em  A7 | Dm G7 |
```
to end in a 3-6-2-5, and if doing that it's pretty natural to use
```
| ...  | Fma */Eb | Dm  G7 | C    |
```
to get to the B section, where `*` can be either Ebdim = F#dim
or an Fm7.

But I think it's also common to go `F7  Bb` in bar 6 (the "Jazz Guitar
Scrapbook" video above suggests this as a starting point for simplifications)
and that will pretty naturally lead into:
- Am, Em, or C (all of them acting as tonic in backdoor dominant)
- A7, in which case it's tritone sub style dominant shift
  - You could play A7 a full bar then Dm G7 for 1st / 3rd A
  - When heading into B, play A7, Dm, G7, C for 2 beats each


### Some of the more exciting outside changes to try

## Backcycling and tritone subs on bars 1-4

One option that sounds very different but is actually just backcycling
is to do a 3-6-2-5- into the III that starts the 3rd bar, which means
starting on a flat 6 / sharp 5 minor:
```
| G#m  C#7  | F#m  B7 | Em  A7  | Dm  G7 |
```
This is one of the really standard outside variations.

It's obviously pretty standard to play some tritone stubstitutions; there
are combinatorial options for how to mix things but a particularly
interesting option because it hints at a coltrane substituion (which I'll
cover shortly) is to play
```
| C  Eb7  | Ab7   G7 | C  Eb7  | Ab7   G7 |
```
for the first 4 bars.

## Coltrane cadences on bars 1-4

What gets interesting is that by just tweaking the flavor of the Ab to major we
can extend this into a 2-bar coltrane cadence targeting Em:
```
| C  Eb7  | Ab   B7 | Em  A7  | Dm   G7 |
```

But at this point we've already noted a coltrane cadence, what if we just
keep it going? This is actually a standard (ish) option that one of my
walking bassline books has; it will feel a little more different though
because we resolve back a bar earlier than "standard" rhythm changes:
```
| C  Eb7  | Ab   B7 | E   G7  | C     |
```

At this point, though, we now have a complete coltrane cycle, which
we know we can turn around and run the opposite direction (ascending
thirds, like the second part of Giant Steps), and it will work
roughly the same way in terms of resolution:
```
| C   B7  | E   Eb7 | Ab   G7  | C     |
```

Note that with either of these, the C can pretty easily resolve into
either a C7 or a Gm -> C7 and it will feel very natural.

But in addition, ending with a bar of C will lead very naturally to...

## Coltrane cadences on bars 5 and 6

Another option the walking bassline book pointed out was starting
the *second* 8 of the A section with a descending Coltrane sequence:
```
| Bbm  Eb7  | Ab    | Dm   G7  | C   (G7)
```
where the Ab generally resolves a tritone to Dm on any of the A
sections, and we'd throw the G7 in if we're not headed into B.

This works pretty well since Fm is an option anyway on bar 6,
so the Coltrane movement to an Ab winds up just subbing in the
relative major.

Jumping straight to the Bbm from a G7 coming out of bar 4
works and is what the book has, but you could also play a C
there and still get a Coltrane cadence. And if you play a
Coltrane cycle for bars 1-4 then you end with a bar of C
anyway so it will work particularly well (although sound
more Coltrane and less Gershwin for sure).



# Some video lessons + notes on how to think about soloing

TODO fill me

## What about the B section?

Most of these videos focus on the "A" section; in the "B" section
it's usually a bit easier to follow the chords, and the most
common additional techniques are:
- emphasizing the root on bars 1&2 and 5&6 (the 3 and 2 of the
  overall key); this is something both the original I've Got Rhythm
  melody and Ben Webster's often-imitated "secondary head" on
  Cotton Tail do, I think it's become a pretty standard vocabulary,
  especially when doodling over a head that has no B section melody.
- explicitly playing a minor for a bar before the major, to add
  some more implied harmony to the lines
- playing a little outside, for example by using the extra time to do some
  side-stepping or by using tritone substitutions / altered scales
  to get some more interesting "modal interchange" type tension.
