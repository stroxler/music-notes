(verse)

It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh

(A)

Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay

(B)

Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting

(A)

And through these moments apart
memories live in my heart

(B)

When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street
