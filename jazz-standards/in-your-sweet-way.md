I can't convey
How much I did your caual style
How much you thrill me when you smile
In your own sweet way

And the things you say
Make me forget the times I swore
You wouldn't fool me anymore
In your own sweet way

I know I'm just another
That you've added to your list
We've kissed
But will you ever take me seriously


Perhaps someday
You'll realize just how I feel
When you turn on that wild appeal
In your own sweet way
