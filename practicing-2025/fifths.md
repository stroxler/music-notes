# Mandolin

Mel Bay's Anthology of Mandolin music seems like a solid start.

There are a decent number of other books.


# Violin

I got the second All Strings book; it's not bad, but too basic and the
library doesn't appear to have any of the later books.


# Cello

The Feuillard "methode du jeune violoncelliste" is pretty decent as
a starter... something I really like is that as a bonus it's a pretty
good fingerstyle baritone reading book: the range lines up to play
the duets on guitar!
