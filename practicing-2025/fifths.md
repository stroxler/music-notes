# Tenor guitar and banjo

There's exaclty one tenor guitar book; it didn't look great although
it's probably worth looking at anyway at some point.

There are two tenor banjo methods that both looked decent; I got the
one by Fred Sokolow, which was shorter and a little more intro-level.

I would definitely check these out again; there's good info and chord
charts for early jazz and old time music.

# Mandolin

Mel Bay's Anthology of Mandolin music seems like a solid start.

There are a decent number of other books.


# Violin

I got the second All Strings book; it's not bad, but too basic and the
library doesn't appear to have any of the later books.


# Cello

The Feuillard "methode du jeune violoncelliste" is pretty decent as
a starter... something I really like is that as a bonus it's a pretty
good fingerstyle baritone reading book: the range lines up to play
the duets on guitar!
