# Best library books

The First 50 Bluegrass solos book is solid (Fred Sokolow is usually good),
that's probably the only guitar book I've seen so far worth getting again.

There are quite a lot of Mandolin books and I suspect a few of them are
worthy of serious study, but I need to learn to read and play first!
