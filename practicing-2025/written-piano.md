# My Plan

My plan is to:
 - First race through the Faber books
 - Then, study Thompson at a more measured pace in parallel with:
   - Reviewing the Faber lesson books e2e at least once per week
   - Lots and lots of easy jazz, both the standards books and Richards
   - Working through all the other Faber books at a very measured pace


Once I get to Thompson, it might be worth thinking about whether to get any
other intermediate level non-jazz books.

I looked online and the only strong recommendation I saw was 'The Intermediate
Pianost' by Marshall and Hammond. I think it's probably worth a shot for two
reasons:
 - Like Faber, I think it aims to develop more general skills vs Thompson's
   strong focus on classical; the sample I read, for example, seemed to
   include discussion of latin rhythms which seems awesome and useful!
 - There's a 2-book advanced series, so if I like the book then there will
   be quite a bit more material I could dig into after.

The other thing to think about is non-method material; the Bach Preludes
would be fantasitc to work through in parallel and Dad has a few other
repertoire books I probably could skim (many of the tunes show up in Thompson
anyway, but some don't - I think Fur Elise might be in one of them).


# What I am doing in the short term

Reveiw Faber 4 lesson book. Focus at this point is on
 - Grand Central, The Spy, and Great Barrier Reef (the roughest)
 - Chanson (haven't started yet)
 - French Minuet, Bouree, Gigue (challenging and iI like)
Most notably missing from that list:
 - I'm ready to skip Wild Flowers and Ceremony for Peace on most reads
 - I'm still putting off the Bach prelude for the moment

Start working through Faber 5. At the moment, the focus is on:
 - St Louis Blues: top priority is to move this to review stage
   - Why? B/c I don't want to spend too much time practicing a form that
     skips the interlude, but I do really want to lock in the physical aspects
     of the arrangement which is pretty nice!
 - I'm ready to add Fanfare on America, which is pretty tricky
 - Jazz Reflection, Tumbleweed, Autumn Ba.
 - Smoky Mtn Prelude and Pomp and Circumstance are getting close to review stage
 - ... I'm ready to at least run through all the other tunes and figure out
   what to add next after Fanfare on America
A few that I'm currently mostly skipping:
 - Carillion is already at a review stage
 - I'm planning to permanently skip Rhythm Flight and Ballade in this book
   (Ballade is in Thompson and I'd rather delay it, I don't like R.F.)


Start reading the easy jazz and blues books!
- Especially after vacation, this should actually be my main focus
- I should be aggressively interspersing the straight-up reading practice with other approaches
  to the same tunes:
  - Transposing the arrangements by sight - start at least trying this pretty early!
  - Spicing up the arrangements a bit rhythmically and harmonically
  - Just comping the chords on piano and singing
  - Playing the roots on u-bass, and then transposing
  - Pausing to explore whether the tune is suitable for deep study e.g. on bass :)


I already started Thompson 3, but I'm going to put that on hold for now in favor of Faber
and easy jazz... I'm planning to take it on vacation, so save it for then!

I'll start working all the other Faber books - starting with the most useful
music - once I've done the lesson books. I will start with these:
- Strawberry Malt F4PB p8
- Three Blues Pieces F4PB p26
- New York, New York F4PR p24
- Bearcat Boogie - F5PB p24
- Over the Rainbow - F5PR p12
- Summertime - F5PR p16
- Take Five - F5PR p40
- All of Faber BigTime piano
