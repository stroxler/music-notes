# My Plan

My plan is to:
 - First race through the Faber books
 - Then, study Thompson at a more measured pace in parallel with:
   - Reviewing the Faber lesson books e2e at least once per week
   - Lots and lots of easy jazz, both the standards books and Richards
   - Working through all the other Faber books at a very measured pace


Once I get to Thompson, it might be worth thinking about whether to get any
other intermediate level non-jazz books.

I looked online and the only strong recommendation I saw was 'The Intermediate
Pianost' by Marshall and Hammond. I think it's probably worth a shot for two
reasons:
 - Like Faber, I think it aims to develop more general skills vs Thompson's
   strong focus on classical; the sample I read, for example, seemed to
   include discussion of latin rhythms which seems awesome and useful!
 - There's a 2-book advanced series, so if I like the book then there will
   be quite a bit more material I could dig into after.

The other thing to think about is non-method material; the Bach Preludes
would be fantasitc to work through in parallel and Dad has a few other
repertoire books I probably could skim (many of the tunes show up in Thompson
anyway, but some don't - I think Fur Elise might be in one of them).


# What I am doing in the short term

Reveiw Faber 4 lesson book.
 - Focus mainly on Chanson, the only one I'm still really *learning*
Skip:
 - The Bach Prelude, which I'm still putting off for now
 - Volga Boatment and Ceremony for Peace

Working on Faber 5:
 - The classical stuff is on hold:
   - I'm going to skip Ballade, and cover it in Thompson instead
   - I'm close to ready to start the others, I delayed them so I could focus
 - Everything else is in progress:
   - The end of Tumbeweed needs work, most of it is okay-ish
   - Fanfare on America, Sunrise, and Shenandoah all need work


Once Faber is all in review, I will:
 - Focus most of my energy on:
   - easy jazz standards
   - the Richards jazz method book
 - Start slowly on Thompson
 - Start slowly on the supplemental Faber books
 - Start slowly on Bach Preludes
 - Peruse all the classical repertoire books I have from Turney
 - Consider getting the intermediat method book volume 2


For the supplemental Faber books, at first I want to really focus on just
the jazzy and bluesy stuff, don't try to tackle classical or pop:
- Strawberry Malt F4PB p8
- Three Blues Pieces F4PB p26
- New York, New York F4PR p24
- Bearcat Boogie - F5PB p24
- Over the Rainbow - F5PR p12
- Summertime - F5PR p16
- Take Five - F5PR p40
- All of Faber BigTime piano
