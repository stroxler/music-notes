# My Plan

I've raced through the Faber lesson books and now am at least slightly
familiar with every tune.

Until vacation, I'm focused mainly on Faber lesson books and J&B

My top practice priorities for right now are:
 - Chanson
 - Bach Prelude
 - Shenandoah
 - Whirlwind
 - Fanfare on America
 - All of Jazz&Blues
   - Skip 'Cast Your Fate' and 'Equinox'
   - Initial focus: A-Train, Autumn Leaves, first blues
   - Second focus: Desafinado, A Taste of Honey, second blues
   - Finally all the others (I really like the arrangements!)


My plan for Q1 written piano is the following:
 - Start reviewing Faber 4L, 5L, J&B weekly
   - At first, aim for several cycles per week until things are locked in
   - Eventually though I want to do one per week and focus on other material
 - Focus a lot of my time on jazz:
   - the BigTime jazz/blues book - everything I don't dislike
   - Start working through the *written* material in Tim Richards
   - Aim to learn *all* the tunes the 'first 50' books
 - Beging to *slowly* study additional material:
   - High-value supplemental Faber material: do these first
     - Strawberry Malt F4PB p8
     - Three Blues Pieces F4PB p26
     - New York, New York F4PR p24
     - Bearcat Boogie - F5PB p24
     - Over the Rainbow - F5PR p12
     - Summertime - F5PR p16
     - Take Five - F5PR p40
   - Thompson book 3, straight through
   - As I tackle Thompson, in parallel I can also slowly tackle:
     - The rest of the supplemental Faber books
     - The Bach preludes book
     - the repertoire books from Turney

Probably order 'The Intermediate Pianist' by Marshall and Hammond (volume3):
 - It's very highly reviewed and has a 2-book 'Advanced' follow-up
   - They get as far as (e.g.) a Bach invention and a Chopin nocture
   - These are the only method books other than Thompson that go this far
 - Why volume 3? Two reasons:
   - My estimation is that Faber 4 and 5 are about the level of volume 2
   - Volume 3 is the first volume that has material I really want to try
