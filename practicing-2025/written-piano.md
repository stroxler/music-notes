# My Plan

My plan is to:
 - First study the Faber lesson books in parallel with easy jazz stuff
 - Then, study Thompson in parallel with both
   - The additional Faber books, tackled slowly
   - More easy jazz (the easy jazz is a lot of material, may take a while)

As I move through Thompson, I may need to look for more material. A couple ideas:
 - The Intermediate Pianist (Marshall and Hammond) Level 3 might be useful:
   - it was recommended, and the sample included stuff I care about like latin rhythm
   - it is part of a series that includes two advanced books, so there's room to grow
 - Someone online recommended Exploring Jazz Piano (Tim Richards)
   - There are lots of videos online: https://www.youtube.com/@SchottM/search?query=exploring%20jazz%20piano
   - It seems promising, reasonably aligned with Siskind's stuff. My hope is it's a bit more *reading*
     which might help bridge the full-on jazz approach of Siskind with the easy jazz standards arrangements

I'm pretty confident from some reviews that both of these are worth purchasing (unfortunately
neither is available from the library).

# What I am doing in the short term

Reveiw Faber 4 lesson book. I'm now ready to focus on just the 7 tunes I like most:
- French Minuet, Grand Central Station, Bouree, and Chanson
- Gigue, Great Barrier Reef, and the Bach prelude

Start working through Faber 5:
- I'm skipping Rhythm Flight and Ballade (the last two tunes; I'll cover Ballade in Thompson)
- I should initially focus on two subsets of the tunes:
  - My least favorites: Carrillion Fantasia, Two Guitars, and Smoky Mountain Prelude (p42-49)
  - The most useful: Jazz Re. (p4), Tumbleweed (p12), Autumn Ba. (p24), St Louis Bl. (p30)
- Once I have those subsets down, start trying to nail the entire book (through p49)


Start reading the easy jazz and blues books!
- Especially after vacation, this should actually be my main focus
- I should be aggressively interspersing the straight-up reading practice with other approaches
  to the same tunes:
  - Transposing the arrangements by sight - start at least trying this pretty early!
  - Spicing up the arrangements a bit rhythmically and harmonically
  - Just comping the chords on piano and singing
  - Playing the roots on u-bass, and then transposing
  - Pausing to explore whether the tune is suitable for deep study e.g. on bass :)


I already started Thompson 3, but I'm going to put that on hold for now in favor of Faber
and easy jazz... I'm planning to take it on vacation, so save it for then!

I'll start working all the other Faber books - starting with the most useful
music - once I've done the lesson books. I will start with these:
- Strawberry Malt F4PB p8
- Three Blues Pieces F4PB p26
- New York, New York F4PR p24
- Bearcat Boogie - F5PB p24
- Over the Rainbow - F5PR p12
- Summertime - F5PR p16
- Take Five - F5PR p40
- All of Faber BigTime piano
