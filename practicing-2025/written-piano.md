# My Plan

- Race to get all of F4LB starting with The Spy (or maybe Marzuka)
- Go through F4LB at least once per week going forward
- Start going through T3 systematically, and working on 1-2 'backog' tunes


# F4LB Status

I'm planning on indefinitely reviewing on everything starting with The Spy.

The goal is to play through all tunes very slowly, aiming for nearly no
mistakes, at least once per week. In addition, pick one or more tunes per week
to really practice, working toward getting them up to the actual speed.

At the moment my top priorities are:
- Bouree, especially the second half
- Wild Flowers, starting at bar 8 (just the modulation section)
- French Minuet... it's actually in decent shape, but I want it perfect (I *like* it)
- Chanson
- Great Barrier Reef

I'm slightly avoiding the Bach prelude, because it's the one tune I'm sure I
will have in my permanent repertoire (so it's more important to really learn
everything *else* right now).

# T3 Status

I'm actively working on the Carmen tune + Londonberry Air.

I should be regularly (every day or two) reveiwing everything from the start.

There's nothing so far I'm readly to mostly move on from.
