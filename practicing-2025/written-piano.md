# Upcoming

In general my intent is to focus on Thompson book 3 as my
main driver of progress, while also leveraging:
- Faber LB 4 as something I can hammer through very fast, and
  then review consistently as my primary supplement.
- All other Faber books will, for the moment, be used exclusively
  to get a handful of jazz (or bluegrass) relevant tunes to work
  on because that's the one big weakness of Thompson.
- I'll continue to pull favorites from Thompson 2 to work on,
  and eventually have a short repertoire list that I review regularly
  like Faber 4
