A few notes on how to use musescore to work on lead sheets:
- Before adding chords, set the chord style:
  - Go to Format -> Styles -> Chords
  - Set the chord stile to "Jazz"
- To add a chord above any note or rest, use cmd-K
- To set fixed bars per measure, the easiest thing is to:
  - First make a selection (often the whole song)
  - Then, go to Format -> Add / Remove System Breaks
- If you want playback to swing, you can do that under
  Format -> Styles.
