# Easy piano books from the library: tune listing

I'm considering trying to focus on jazz piano for
real. If I do that, it will likely mean mostly focusing
on fundamentals rather than reading, and I think the
easy jazz collections from SFPL might be great supplementary
reading material.

The idea with this is to focus on
(a) reading music
(b) learning the tunes
(c) internalizing some ideas for how to do beginner-level
    jazz standard arrangements, including voicings and the
    basslines.

### The Faber book

The SFPL books are much better in that they have far more material,
but the Faber book does have a few nice arrangments I should learn:
- Georgia on my Mind is actually pretty nice
- Satin Doll is okay, and it's a tune I need to learn anyway
- Misty seems decent
- Lullaby of Birdland is good
- Perdido is decent
- Desafinado(!!)

## The First 50 Jazz Standards

This one has pretty high-quality arrangements, I think the overall playing
level might be slightly higher than the jazz classics book.

So it's a real goal not just to work on my reading and learn the tunes, but
also study how they are actually putting together pretty nice-sounding
beginner-level arrangement.

- The Girl From Ipanema p46 ... this one I don't exactly like but I need to learn!

- Alone Together p2
- All of me p5
- All the things you are p8 (has the verse)
- Autumn in New York p12
- Body and Soul p15
- But Not for Me p20
- Don't Get Around p26 (this arrangement is pretty fun!)
- Easy Living p29
- Fly Me to the Moon p32 (as a waltz)
- A Foggy Day p35
- How High the Moon p50
- I'll Remember Aprik p57
- If I should Lose You p60
- In a Sentimental Mood p62
- It could Happen to You p65




## The First 50 Jazz Classics

This book is more eclectic, it has some great tunes including instrumental
standards. But it also has more arrangements I don't care for much, I'm listing
off only the tunes that I both think I should learn *and* I liked the
arrangement okay.

The main goal for this book is just to improve my reading and learn the tunes,
I don't think the arrangements are quite as good as the other book so they
don't deserve as much study as arrangements per se.
