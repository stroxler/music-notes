# Basic Scale Exercises

These are more useful to play with LH chords and RH scales,
but really you should eventually learn both (you could choose
to play only quarter notes in the LH if you want, since
the main overlapping skill is walking bassline).

The really important thing here is:
- developing independence, the ability to grab chords fast
  while multitasking
- drilling comping rhythms while playing straight 8ths; by
  far the most important are:
  - charleston, delayed charleston
  - reversed charleston, always-half-beat-early
  - variations on ^ that involve double hits
  - dotted quarter note patterns

The basic diatonic patterns for chord changes:
- Circle of 5ths 4-note close moving down
- Circle of 5ths triads moving up
- Looping I-IV-II-V or III-VI-II-V

Practice these thinking about the chords both as
rooted (starting off of 1) and rootless (starting off of 3)

# Scale exercises for later

Diatonic movement with diminished passing chords, or
maybe Barry Harris style movement with diminished passing
between chord *shapes* of the same chord.

Scale exercises that modulate. Johnny recommends running
through all the chord flavors rooted on a single note, I
would slightly favor instead focusing on key changes,
in particular the most common three by far are:
- major to dominant -> change up a fourth
- dominant to minor -> change down a fourth (V becomes II)
- major to minor -> change down a whole step (I becomes II)
