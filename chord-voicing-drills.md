# How to construct drills (instrument agnostic)

## How to design a progression to drill?

You want to drill a short chord progression that you can
loop fairly quickly.

There are two basic categories of progressions:
- diatonic progressions that stay in one key
- progressions that modulate

This leads to two main varieties of drills:
- modulation drills, where you repeat a short progression
  and rapidly hit a bunch of keys.
- diatonic drills, where you loop repeatedly. To make this
  valuable, you need one of a few things:
  - it has to be so new that even a short loop is a challenge
  - or, you should change something every `n` iterations, e.g.:
    - switch voicing types every 2-4 iterations
    - stop and change key every few iterations
  - or, you need to combine the otherwise-boring drill with some
    *other* challenge, for example:
    - loop a progression and focus on challenging rhythms
    - or (piano-specific) do something easy in one hand, but focus on
      independence, for example easy LH chords + RH improv

You can also make a kind of hybrid by looping some diatonic progression
(the obvious option is a 6-2-5) inside of a longer progression that
modulates; this is a good idea anyway if the modulation is tricky because
it gives your ear some time to adapt to each key.

### Some examples of progressions

- A really good diatonic drill is to just run through the entire
  IV-VII-III-VI-II-V-I; if you jump up at IV, you can use this to
  traverse variations in voicings, e.g. move up or down one position
  or variation each iteration; as a bonus if you struggle with any
  iteration you can just loop it until it's locked in.
- FILL ME WITH MORE PROGRESSIONS

### Things to focus on when playing chord drills

For the movement itself, Jono recommends working at slow speeds on playing
staccato and moving as fast as possible, as early as possible, to the next
thing to play. This has several effects:
- it pushes the movement itself to be fast very early
- it lets you use the space between moving and playing to try to correct
  any innacuracy by *feel*, which is a good way to get feedback
- it also gets you in the habit of thinking about the *next* thing to play,
  which counteracts a tendency to sort of "hang out" on a part of a song
  and not be thinking ahead enough

For time, the most important thing is using a metronome. But Romain Pilon
recommends a more specific exercise, which is to use an *offset* metronome
in order to make sure you can't get lost. His suggestions for a tune
in 4 are to:
- start out by clicking every 3 or 5 beats
- for additional challenge, click every 1.5 or 2.5 beats; 1.5 is
  particularly important since drummers often inject a dotted quarter
  pattern.
  - Note that to do this with a metronome you have to play straight 8ths;
    a really nice investment in simple computer music would be to make
    a little metronome tool that can do this in swing :)

For rhythm, you want to investigate comping patterns and learn to play
them; obvious starting points are:
- the charleston and variations
  - playing on the and of both 4 and 2 (Charlie likes this, and I
    think it's a little trickier to pull off)
  - varying the time, typically either an 8th note delay or flip 1 vs 4
  - adding double hits (this doesn't need as much practice as ^)
- dotted quarter note patterns
- various latin patterns, especially bossa

Eventually though it would be good to study albums and how the
rhythm section actually comps, which will usually be a combination of
the patterns above with a few other things mixed in.


## What kinds of things should I drill on guitar?

For now, I really want to focus on mastering just a few things that are
maximally useful in a combo setting:
- 2-note 3-and-7 / 3-and voicings on strings 2&3 *or* 3&4
  - These are boring, but also the easiest to master 100%. The goal is to be
    able to sight read even tricky charts *fast* if I strip down to just this.
  - I can also focus more on rhythm if I strip the vocings down to nothing
- 3-note voicings on strings 4-2:
  - voicings based on 3-5-7 and 7-1-3 (simulated shearing reductions)
  - voicings based on 3-7-1 and 7-3-5 (these are drop-2 lower reductions)
  - voicings based on 1-3-7 and 5-7-3 (these are drop-2 upper reductions)
  - triad voicings, which comes with some mental gymnastics
    - for jazz, focus on viewing them as built off 3 or 6
    - but it's good to be able to think about them as rooted as well
- 4-note voicings on strings 5-2:
  - drop-2 voicings, including:
    - basic voicings, and extensions (especially when 1 and 5 are on top)
    - the mental gymnastics for rootless voicings built off the 3
    - the mental gymnastics for major and minor 6 voicings built off 6
    - the extra cases: major and minor 6/9 chords, minor 11 chords.
  - simulated shearing voicings, especially extensions built off them

There are far more things to focus on later ()


## What kinds of things should I drill on Piano?

### Two-handed comping drills

For now, focus on just a couple things:
- LH plays 3 and 7, RH plays 9 and 5 (Siskind's "A" and "B")
- LH gets bass + either 7 or 9, and RH fills in gaps
  - this is harder and less formulatic, but useful to practice

Keep in mind that you'd mostly use 2-handed comping in a combo,
in which case the most important thing is actually time, rhythm,
and listening rather than how fancy your voicings are!

### Left-hand-plays-bass, Right hand does X

The left hand can do 4 main things, each trickier and more interesting:
- Play just the bass note
- Play a bassline in 2
- Play a bassline in 4 (walking bass)
- Play some other kind of patterned bass, for example:
  - various kinds of latin basslines
  - (mainly for blues) something closer to a boogie pattern
  - something more funky or rock-inspired

The right hand can then do a variety of things, either chords or
some kind of melodic thing.

### Left-hand-plays-chords, Right hand does X

Options for what the left hand can do:
- Play just 3 and 7 (or 6)
- Play 4-note close voicings, or (typically sounds better) 3 note reductions
- Play rootless 4-note close voicings
- Play as many quartal voicings as possible

### Right hand plays X = chords

- Play just 3 and 7
- Play a 4-note close, or (typically nicer sounding) a 3-note reduction
- Play a rootless 4 note voicing or 3-note reduction

### Right hand plays X = single-note stuff

For now, start with a few limited options:
- Plain scales, especially if the LH is doing something difficult
- Scale patterns, for now probably with not too much switching
- Arpeggios
- Scales with switching per chord, for now focus on straight up-and-down

There are a lot more valuable things to work on later that come a lot
closer to real improvisation, for example:
- scale patterns and switching at the same time, especially:
  - pentatonic patterns with switching per chord
  - coltrane patterns
  - mixing in various 7-9 note scales more aggressively, e.g.:
    - as many melodic minors as you can handle
    - augmented scales in as many places as they fit
    - diminished scales in as many places as they fit
    - tritone-substitued mixiolydian or lydian-dominant
- diatonic and chromatic enclosure drills
- triad pair patterns, with a pair per chord
- memorizing licks and integrating them into chord progression drills

### More of a stretch at this point: Stride-like patterns

Left hand plays bass *and* a chord, and right hand does X.

If you do this on a faster ragtime-like feel it will be stride, but
the same approach can work on medium swing or on ballads.

The main thing to focus on here is speed and accuracy of the left
hand movement; Jono says the best way to practice is staccato.
