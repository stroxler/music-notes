## Ideas from Mimi's Masterclass

Mimi likes to construct counterpoint by using
arpeggios to connect a sort of low and high voice.

When in doubt, she likes to aim to land on the 3 of
any new chord; you can do the same thing with any
extension note, but especially in solo playing the 3
gives you a great scaffold.

Something Mimi and Ned both emphasize is thinking
in shapes. Mimi considers connecting all the tools
in one map important "everywhere I am, the entire
harmonic universe is". Pretty similar to how Ned
talks about orienting himself around the root chords.

Byzantine / Hungarian Minor: it's typically called
Hungarian minor when it starts off the minor root;
it's called Byzantine when it starts off the 5. Mimi
essientially rediscovered it when working on Caravan,
inspired by the B natural in the melody... it makes
a kind of sense against the Db7 too, that's another
way of thinking how it fits against the vamp.
- She likes to use it as a way to pull some extra
  color out on a minor blues sometimes; this is
  interesting since minor blues can be a bit bland.
- It's always usable on a harmonic minor vamp, it's
  just a blues substitution, but the Byzantine off
  the 5 (or the harmonic minor) is also an alternative
  to the normal altered scale.

Her suggestions for arpeggios:
- Start by focusing on just a couple of positions
  (not sure I'd take this advice, it's hard to apply
  in context if you don't learn enough to stay
  in a position across changes)
- Play the arpeggios over tunes. This one is great
  advice, and I don't do it enough! I really should
  take this idea and apply it to all the techniques,
  like Ned's dyads or CF's organic scales, as well -
  the idea is that straight 8th note runs that are
  mechanical are a good way to internalize both
  the sound and shape.
- Ideally, spend at least some of your time trying
  to practice the arpeggio where you target landing
  on 3 of each new chord, which will always outline
  the harmony well, and it's typically not part of
  the previous chord (this idea applies to bass and
  comping too, Ned emphasized this)
  - Although playing a common tone is obviously also
    an option, sort of the opposite one, that you
    can use in both comping and soloing, and even
    as a bass pedal
- Her main exercise is to just arpeggiate up and
  down alternate chords, but she does work on
  skip-note playing which is another leap-y motion
  and a bit closer to Ned's pattern.

## Fareed's Masterclass

### Time feel of the ensemble

His first observation on time feel:
- The jazz march (Freddie Green, walking bass,
  high hat) is a march and wants to rush, it
  should be ahead, at the top of the beat
- The modern comping rhythms should be more in
  the middle, it's like glue and helps control
  the rush
- The melody and soloist often play behind
... This leads to a fat beat, the out-of-sync-ness
is part of how swing gets its feel, because it creates
a thick texture.

### How to work on comping

Fareed's approach to comping:
- Start with guide tones, the two pairs of voicings
  - Ideally, learn both voicings on strings 3 and 4, but it's very good to
    learn strings 4 and 5 up high on the neck as well, and for me probably also
    strings 2 and 3 just for good measure
- Within that schema, try to practice comping focusing on rhythm so it's
  interesting:
  - Fareed likes to actually vocalize a drum part while he does this
- Then, add bass notes and practice Freddie Green style... ideally be able to
  play both 1 and 5 note on strings 5 / 6 comfortably, which also will
  naturally lead into a 2-feel or bossa bassline
  - With the freddie green, make sure to leave space by muting
    the upbeats. And try to push the rhythm, you want top of the
    beat
- Then add extensions, first one and then two

While you do this, keep in mind a few things:
- You can play hits a half step up *or* down to accent things
- You can suspend or hit a secondary dominant to accent things
- You can use moving extensions to accent things

Eventually, start working on adding melody.
- You can potentially play melody above the guide tones, as chord-melody,
  but this can be a bit challenging.
- Fareed and Mimi both like the approach where you hit the chords now
  and then while mostly playing single note meldoy.
- This is obviously good to do with tunes, but also improv. And if you
  use various forms of restricted practice for the improv, it's a way
  to "glue together" the two "strands" of practicing tunes a bit more,
  by working on accompaniment voicings and melodic ideas together... this
  is one way to get more plugged in to Mimi's "harmonic universe" at each
  location.

### Freddie Green chord theory

Freddie green's rules of basic chord substitution:
- Anything can be a dominant, unless it clashes w/melody
- Any chord can have a secondary dominant, often but not always played as a
  pickup ... a half step up *is* a secondary dominant (a tritone sub)
- Any dominant can have it's minor / suspension played (often over
  half the original chord duration rather than as a pickup)
  - The idea that the minor part of a II-VI is just the suspension is
    a key idea to Fareed; it also might be a useful unifying concept
    when exploring Maiden Voyage-type tunes.

An exercise Fareed likes to emphasize the dominant idea is play a
I-IV-vii-iii-vi-ii-V-I but use all dominants, so it's just a tritone
moving down (with the IV and vii the same). This idea is interesting
in that you can apply it to other progressions and use it as a scaffold,
then optionally add any combination of non-dominant tonalities or
suspensions in to break up the tritones a bit:
- For example, it's already basically a back-cycled circle of fifths
  starting on #VI. Maybe use the minor for the #IV (i.e. supension of
  the VII) when you do this.
- But you could apply the same idea to rhythm changes, coltrane changes,
  Great American Songbook standards, etc.

### A couple more observations on comping

Fareed uses a lot of both tritone subs and more general chromatic
motion (both upper and lower neighbor chords) when he plays what Randy
Vincent likes to call "walking guitar", i.e. Freddie-Green style rhythm
but with a lot of motion. He also mixes in some upstrokes here and there,
very similar to how bass players hit the odd 8th note when walking.

For bossa, Fareed thinks playing just the shells is fine... this is the
default approach I should probably take for now in 4ths tuning since
it's kind of tricky to grab extensions.

But in addition, when Fareed was comping latin feel, he used a lot
of repeated bass notes, not always alternating, so he obviously thinks
that is fine, and I can use the same idea. You can potentially use
a combination of suspensions, moving extensions, or chord substitution
to add movement if it gets boring.

### Melodic language

Fareed is a huge fan of starting off pentatonics. The starting
point is to play major or minor pentatonic, and try to play a mostly
rhythmic idea using just couple notes (a bit like Adam Maness's "take
your snare solo" idea). You can combine the pentatonics and add
the blues scale note to add some more flavor.

His rough advice over what to default to:
- On rhythm changes and a lot of GAS tunes, start with the major
  pentatonic and go minor when you want some bluesy feel.
- On bluesy tunes, start with the minor pentatonic and go major
  when you want to add some jazzier snazz.

A very easy way to add just a bit of bebop-ism on top of this
is to play some enclosures *around* the pentatonic notes.

From there, if we want to lean into pentatonics you can do lots
of things:
- To get a more open sound, play a pentatonic off the five or
  the 9 (in major this will sound lydian, in minor it will sound
  dorian - think Footprints; note that it's pretty closely
  connected to So What chords).
- To play a more outside, take the idea that there's a minor third
  connection (as in, Gm and Jm both work on a J) and extend it
  to the full cycle of thirds (so for a blues in J, you can
  borrow from the Em and Km pentatonics).
- You can also obviously side-step.
  - Side-stepping down is mostly crunch
  - Side-stepping up can potentially imply other things; side-stepping
    up to the bIIma pentatonic is a bit neapolitan sounding, side-stepping
    to the bIImi pentatonic is also potentially implying an altered scale.

All the fancier pentatonics need to be grounded in the safer ones first,
you've got to be able to really hear it to play it successfully and
musically.

Similarly, pulling in all the classic bebop material (more enclosures,
arpeggios, etc) is great but you generally want to sprinkle it in
on top of the pentatonics (or quadratonics or organic scales - whatever
your basic "simple" building block is, doesn't have to be a pentatonic).
The bebopisms are great, but you can't really build a whole solo out
of them, it's mentally exhausting and wouldn't sound that good anyway.

## Mimi Quotes

"Guides are only Guides" / "A guide is merely a guide"

## Our homework

Blue Bossa - focus on guide tone lines, with a secondary focus
on on bass lines and extensions.

Try to explore the idea of substituting dominants, adding secondary
dominants, and suspending chords as well if we can.

# 2025-08-2025

## Fareed's master class

Diminished chords: they don't really exist - they are functioning
as dominant chords. Your task is to figure out what dominant.
- An ascending passing diminished is typically functioning like the
  dominant a third below.
- A descending passing diminished is leading the same *direction* as
  a secondary dominant, but the notes are actually like the parallel
  dominant of the target (which is almost always a minor chord). You often
  could sub it with the secondary dominant, although it depends on the
  melody.

Half diminished chords: they do exist, but it's sometimes more productive to
think of them as the minor 6 off of 3.
- This also implies that for half diminished, 1 and 5 will work about as well
  as 3 and 7 for outlining the chord.
- But if there's a bass you ideally wouldn't double, so actually either 3 and 7
  with the flat 5 is probably a better idea in an ensemble context.

When practicing guide tone playing, a couple more things to try:
- Sing the roots as you play - this is really important to actually
  contextualize the comping, you wouldn't play like this w/o a bass!
- Sing the melody as you play, that will also usually help plus it's
  very important to be 
- Another useful exercise is to play a 5 in the bass, which is a better
  choice than 1 if you're playing with a bass player so you don't
  double the root, and maybe sing 1.
  - Ned would disagree about doubling, since his stance is that
    you get a nice 5 from overtones. So you can file away both ideas.

Another thing to practice: three-note skip voicings with guide tones and
an extension played with a gap string (so play only the upper note of a 4-note
voicing with extensions). Reasons:
- This gives you more choices for extension color tones - esp in cases like a
  minor where you might not really want a 13 but a 9 is good
- the spacing of the voicing will have an airier quality, so it can be really
  nice if you want a more whimsical sound
- it also is a great tool to have down for chord melody

Next Fareed went through embelleshing Blue Bossa using dominant substitutions
and voice leading. Then he demonstrated how when playing lines you can use the
same idea to create a lot of jazzy sounds - he demonstrated basically playing
a different chord every 2 beats, where if you're hanging out on a chord for
a while you just jump to its secondary dominant and back again, and then you
play a secondary dominant as a pickup to each next chord. Eventually you
want to do this by ear and potentially hear the subdominant notes as colors,
but as an exercise this works well. You can apply the same idea using
other sounds too like the neapolitan or a secondary subdominant (which will
kind of suspend then resolve) or the parallel dominant instead of the secondary
dominant.

When you have a lot of time, you can throw in not only a secondary dominant
but also it's suspension; on Blue Bossa Fareed likes the second measure of
Cm heading into Lm to demo this - play Fm->J7 as a kind of pickup to the Lm.

Something Fareed likes to do on the second bar of Kma in Blue Bossa is go
to H (could be H7 but he usually does major, either works here). This can
be thought of two ways:
- It's a tritone lead-in to the Dm7b5, which is actually fairly common
  (and is the tritone sub of the parallel dominant lead in, which is also
  common - note that this is similar in function to a descending
  passing chromatic as described above!
- It's also a suspension of the Kma, so it makes good sense in terms of
  where you're coming *from* (if you used an Edim or D7, it would feel
  like more of a non-sequitur).
- You can also play a measure with two beats of Hma and two of D7, which
  can even more smoothly mark the shift back to Cm

On the turnaround, Fareed likes to throw in an an A7, which is a subdominant
for the Dhd but also turns the turnaround into a typical a (dorian) VI-ii-V-i.

Adding all these substitutions with guide tones is a big part of how you can
fill in a solo guitar setup 

Fareed likes to practice these ideas in weird keys and awkward spots on the
guitar, especially low positions where you'll be forced to pick voicings
carefully.

### A couple notes on right hand technique

Benson-style or normal style pick grip are both common and work well
### Substitutions

The most common substitutions other than for dominants are minor
thirds

### Some additional thoughts

Don't play what you don't hear. When you approach jazz, imagine you had
been playing blues for years first - that's what most of the OGs did.

When you comp, be able to hold the melody in your head (not a huge issue
for me ususally, but the same principle applies to bass lines which is
much harder for me).
... Mimi notes that that's true for soling too, hold the melody in mind.

The rhythm is the most important thing:
- You can't really practice it directly in the practice room:
  - You can do exercises (think Romain Pillon and Eric Peralta's exercises)
  - You can transcribe rhythms and get them into your vocabulary
  - Maybe most importantly you can play along with recordings to work on *time*
- But to really do it, you have to play with other people
  - You also have to understand your role, your part. "All modern American
    music is based on African stylings, and African music is part-based"

## Mimi's masterclass

To avoid injury, Mimi's recommendations are:
- Get checkpointed on technique from time to time
  - She noted my posture was bad at one point, although that was an odd situation
    since I was trying not to hit David. Still, be mindful of this.
  - Her point is also validated by my thumb issues a few months back - Richard saw
    right away what I was doing that was weird
- Do warm ups, which for her means:
  - Mobilizations of the hand and shoulder
  - Stretches of the hand and shoulder
  - Make sure your hands are actually warm enough, not cold

Mimi suggests practicing pauses. This is similar to a big thing Charlie focuses on
in solos, but Mimi says it's valuable even in solo guitar where we tend to fill in
a lot, it can build tension (plus, it gives you a breather and a great opportunity
to take a solo in a different direction). It also helps you work on your time, which
needs to be held through pauses!

To get bebop language, Mimi recommends mainly two things:
- Study bebop heads, especially Parker heads, and incorporate that material
- Transcribe - ideally full solos, but snippets are really the building blocks
  of language so you don't have to do full solos
  - The main benefit of full solos is that then you can play along and work on your
    time feel as well as see an example of the "arc" of a solo.

# 2025-08-06

## Fareed's Masterclass

Fareed views hand position as the most important thing for guitar:
- The biggest issue he sees is bending the wrist, your goal is a striaght
  wrist at least in neutral position (chords may change this). The fingers
  should arc to the fingerboard; the palm should be tight to the neck
  at the pinky, this is important, it's what gives you a good arc.
  - I'm guessing this principle is a big part of what I need on bass too
  - He notes that any discomfort on the *back* of your hand is likely
    also related to wrist position
- Exercise: hammer 1-3-2-4 then pull off 4-2-3-1
  - the hammer is very similar to a tapping exercise
  - the pull-offs really test your arc, b/c if you aren't arched enough
    you can't do it, you have to have the tip planted
- He suggests putting the thumb wherever it naturally falls in a relaxed
  hand position - for me, this is opposite the first finger
- It may be useful to play either more classical or John Stowell position
  if you really want to be able to 

This exercise is very valuable: it forces a good hand position which is
absolutely critical for me, and it eventually develops independence as well.

Something he emphasizes with this exercise, but that applies to practice
in general, is that your mind-body connection learns fast if you practice
with patience. Taking a break after some work is very valuable - take 15,
20 minutes off and come back. Sleep on it and come back.

Another 

Fareed notes everything you do has three parts: a beginning (prepare),
a middle (play, act), end (release). He says the key to playing with
good technique, playing fast, and playing with endurance is to understand
this, and that it's particularly common to miss the release.
- this applies to playing chord passages, relax between chords
- it's likely that this is part of what I need to focus on for bass,
  especially playing at uncomfortable tempos

Bossa rhythms:
- The basic building block is (in 16th notes) 2-3 | 2-2-3 | 2-2, which
  is a 4-bar phrase but is felt as 3 "chunks"
- Practice holding this against 1 so you are able to feel both this
  pulse and the actual measures going by.
- The baseline of a true bossa is in 4 with no accent, it's the Brazillian
  equivalent of a walking bass where you don't want to accent and it typically
  doesn't actually alternate 1 and 5, it usually plays 1 or 5 on repeat
  - The alternating feel often used in "jazz bossa" (which is still quarter
    notes, not half notes, in the actual latin style) is actually a samba
    pattern, and usually accents 2 and 4 pretty heavily.
  - Note that both these styles tend to be notated in cut time, which is where
    the idea that these are half notes comes from, but it's more authentic
    to think of these as quarter notes.
  - It's not unusual in a bossa tune to add a *brief* alternating bass, borrowing
    the samba feel (especially common at the turnaround where lots of tunes
    like wave will altertnate chords). It's also possible to actually walk the
    bass, although that's more demanding.

The basic bossa pattern for playing is exactly that pattern above:
F   F     F   F   F   F   F   |
T       T       T     T       |

It's quite common to just use the initial bit on repeat:
F   F     F     F   F     F   |
T       T       T       T     |

To make it more interesting, you can play each of the long chunks
on a higher string set to get some movement, which winds up sounding
very partido alto ish.

## Mimi's Masterclass

Just a thought: Mimi recommends trombone transcription; the range is
roughly guitar-compatible and it's difficult to play really fast
material which often makes it more accessible than other horns.

How to play altered dominants well:
- Typically, you want to use chord-based ideas rather than the
  scale. The altered scale of course has a whole chord scale
  worth of options, but the most common choices would be:
  - I minor 6/9, which captures the sharp 5 of G especially well
  - K dominant (really lydian) 9, which will really drive home both the sharp
    and flat 9  of G; this of course can also be thought of as a tritone
    substitution, I think the Im6 is probably more strongly "altered" sounding
- The main alternative to this is to use the altered pentatonic, which in this
  case is Jminor / K major. That will emphasize the altered tones but leave out
- There are of course other kinds of "altered dominants", the diminished (13b9)
  and whole-tone-based sounds. These will tend to lend themselves more to
  pattern-based playing rather than arpeggios, but obviously you can mix and
  match

Keep working on the arpeggios, in context, especially the altered arpeggios
(and particularly in context of a ii-V-I or a vi-ii-V-i where you play inside
on the ii and I and altered on vi and V) since they can feel like
non-sequitures if you haven't engrained the ideas yet.

You normally wouldn't use any of the above approaches unless harmony is moving.
If you're hanging out a long time on a G7, you probably want to play either
mixolydian or lydian dominant ideas.
- For mixolydian there are a few approaches but the most oft-recommended is
  triad pairs
- Mimi likes lydian dominant more, which has a very gently altered sound.
  Interestingly, she suggests this on Take the A train - practice that,
  and the difference between the lydian dominant vs whole tone sound (either
  works well). She advises whole tone in small doses only.

To start putting arpeggios to use in context, use the same idea Fareed had for
pentatonics: play very rhythmically, using motifs. Still try to target 3's
if you can. If you mix in a few one-octave arpeggios and broken arpeggios
(including ones built off of 3 and altered ones) you'll have some bebop
language.

She recommends Take the A Train as a good tune to work on lydian major as
well.

# 2025-08-07

## Fareed's Masterclass

Jim Hall said he knew about 11 or 12 tunes well - he could follow most tunes
in an ensemble, but only had 11 or 12 he would really do in a trio or solo
setting.

Fareed feels similar, both in jazz and classical - he's got 4-5 hours of
classical he knows, but only maybe an hour or so he could do without prep
time at a performance level.

His 11 or 12 songs are songs he really loves, and he's worked out the
melody and harmony in detail, he has a map of how he'll approach them. You
can hear this in other players too, they improvise, but they know roughly
what works.

He also thinks reading is a valuable skill, but a lot of music isn't meant
to be read on guitar - too much of it requires working out.

"Scales are not used for the most part in jazz - arpeggios, blues and pentatonics,
and riffs are the heart of it"

Fareed's custom guitars have a flat back which avoids feedback, no f-hole which
avoids booming, and a heavy top that gives sustain. You can probably get one
for around $15K and likely a long wait.

### Playing a part with piano

The most basic "part" for jazz guitar is Freddie Green style. When you 
work on this, things to consider:
- The time, you want to be at the top of the beat. This is the most essential
  thing. Ideally, practice singing behind the beat while playing ahead, that's
  tricky to do.
  - Aside, if the soloist is playing ahead, it starts to sound corny. If it's
    super behind it sounds good, starts to sound a bit like Lightning Hopkins;
    you can start falling so far behind you get multiple beats behind.
    - Joe Williams did this a lot!
    - Listen also to Billie Holiday's time.
  - A lot of young players use a metronome heavily because that's taught
    heavily. This isn't bad, but to develop a fatter time feel you'll have to
    do a different thing, listen to different players and bands to understand
    where the parts sit in the beat. You can't get this just from a metronome.
- The gap between strokes, any patterns (Rodney Jones made a big deal of this)

When you do more comping patterns, some stuff to consider:
- Guide tones only won't clash with the piano, so consider that
- Rhythmically, the two obvious options are
  - Play something riff based, with predictable rhythm. This can work really
    well, but it depends on how things line up with the piano
  - Play minimal rhythm, and go for textures; you could do this by
    playing a typical strum on just 1, or more adventruously playing quarter
    notes. But you could also do it by arpeggiating or doing a super slow
    strum.

Miles once told Coltrane: take the horn out of your mouth - when you're not
sure what to play, don't play. Fareed likes to say BB King was a master of
this; he didn't know that much guitar or have chops, but he only played
when and what he was sure of, which was great music.

### Meta-note from a bit of a train wreck

I'm still strugging at the moment to keep my place in the tuning; in
particular, after watching Fareed's neck I had a very hard time.

That is what it is, the solution is a combination of practicing each
tuning and trying to steadily improve my ability to play by feel:
 - Hear where I am clearly, even under stress
 - Map the fingerboard in relative rather than absolute terms
I'm already making limited progress at this, so that's fine.

In particular I should focus on practicing shape-oriented stuff:
 - pentatonics (and to a lesser extent scales)
 - arpeggios and Ned's triad patterns
 - licks and snippets of melodies, mapped against the shapes

Since I have to work on these things for vocabulary anyway, this should
be great. But most of all, make sure to work on your rhythmic feeling.

The bigger challenge I have though is once I get off and disoriented, which can
be my finger position or starting to lose the form, I really struggle:
 - First, I'm not great at picking when to lay out, or at finding my place
   again by ear. These two skills, which go together, are the most important
 - Second, I need to improve my ability to calm down afterward. I was keyed
   up for two solid hours after this, which is not a path to success.


## Mimi's masterclass

Probably the single arpeggio most worth working on is the minor 6. Learn to use
it instinctively and instantly, and internalize the sound, against each of:
- minor 6  (root)
- half diminished  (third)
- dominant 9  (fifth)
- altered dominant  (flat 9)
- major sharp 11 (13) .. actually this one is especially instructive in some
  ways because flipping betwen the minor 6 and minor 7 will give you vanilla vs
  lydian colors.

You can fit the 9 and 11 into almost all of these contexts as well, but start
with the minor 6 shape as your focus (except maybe when actually playing against
a minor 6, then emphasize the 9!!)

This focus actually is at the heart of a lot of Pat Martino's work - he practices
a lot of minor patterns (that's what his hole book is) and applies them to
various chords. His note choice is more scalar than arpeggios, but the correspondence
between the minor and the chord is the same.

The minor 6 is probably the single most important case for me becuase I don't
really have it in my hands and it's applicable in all the colorful chords, but
the same basic principle applies to all the arpeggios (and pentatonics) that
you really want to understand how to use them in multiple contexts. The
handout from Mimi's book really dives into this.
- Examples: on a G7, you can use Fma7 for an inside sus sound, or Ima7 for an
  outside (but still suspended) one. For good measure, you could roll from Ima7
  to Imi6 to drop the suspension.

Recommendations oriented around drums:
- "syncopations for the modern drummer"
- in general you could play the rhythms from drum books (or from transcribing
  bits of drum grooves / solos) just tapping with your hands

---

Stage freight:
- First off, remember the stakes are not that high. That's a useful thing to
  keep in mind when things are rough, which they will be.
- Second, deep breathing and body awareness helps


## Lesson with Fareed

### Hand position

Possibly the single most important thing in the lesson, given my current
struggles: Fareed noticed my fingers weren't as arched as they could be.

I need to keep working and working on maintining a stright wrist and
tight arch. Keep doing his pull-off exercise, that is a big help; it
needs to be at least a warm-up for me permanently.

Keep practicing long hours after a break: if long hours of practice
(single note; chords are a more subtle issue) are bothering me, I
need to start checking my position and doing his exercise more often.

I strongly suspect that my bass issues are, at the root, similar. Something
in my hand position and arch is probably not quite right. This needs to
be my single top priority on bass as well this fall, because my primary
goal for fall is to figure out whether bass is feasible as a primary
instrument.

### Tunings

He started by noting that I play like I don't know my arpeggios, which is
half true; we discussed tuning. He advises I pick a tuning, he thinks 4ths
has disadvantages (true) but that it may work well if I'm mainly listening
to non-guitar players (which I mainly am).

To me this confirms the plan I already had, which is to focus mainly on
my bari in B-4ths; I think I may keep using the Taylor in D-4ths as a
practice tool to help force me to think in grips and relative position
more, but I won't play it in contexts that demand a lot of me anymore.
I *might* still use it for ensemble and NBJ since it's so easy to haul
around, but neither of those are exceptionally demanding contexts.

### Grips as a unit of study

The biggest takeaway I got from the 1:1 lesson is to really focus on grips:
learn the fingerboard in one-octave (maybe two octaves eventually, a "central"
one and a couple extensions around it so that I'm not boxed in).

Each octave will correspond to a one-octave arpeggio of (some inversion of)
any given chord. Study these, and learn tunes in terms of them. And instead
of playing positionally, think about every time a chord changes, shifting
to one of the good "grips" for that chord (or two - it makes sense for example
to learn two overlapping grips as a unit too for common chord changes).

This is a very similar idea to how Mimi actually approaches using arpeggios;
she's really into playing the big two-octave arpeggios, but she actually
plays licks that are rarely much more than an octave and a half. A particularly
fruitful chord to focus on grips for is minor 6 as per the earlier masterclass.

But the same idea applies to other chords (Fareed had me focusing on ma7) as
well as other concepts like quadratonics, pentatonics, or triad pairs. The
most important thing is actually connecting real vocabulary (song snippets,
learned licks, and most of all transcriptions) to the grips.

It's also very similar to how Ned approaches things, he talks a lot about
orienting around one specific grip, but the idea is the same.

You want to learn these grips in the context of actual tunes, and *ideally
also study transpositions of the tune*, using mostly the same grips.

Note that the idea of shifting grips is particularly fruitful on cycle-of-fifths
based patterns, since you'll tend to get a lot of repeated motion; this will
naturally lead you to repetitive, motific vocabulary which is a good thing,
the steriotypical fast-turnaround lick usually *is* repeated.
- If you *also* learn to flip the grips for a tritone substitution, this will
  actually cover quite a lot of tunes (think Satin Doll), and by adding
  a shift on top of that you can probably cover a majority of all modulations
  in great american songbook tunes.
- And once you have these grips, one way to approach coltrane changes (not
  the only or best way, your licks will be truncated) will be to just shift
  the grips a bit differently, versus playing positionally which makes it harder.

It will also natrually lend itself to various attempts to play a little
more outsied, since you can do things like shift the grip a minor 3rd.

Last but not least, Fareed seems to think focusing on these grips, and connecting
my fingers to my ears, might help my ear quite a bit versus where it is now, which
makes a lot of sense to me.

FWIW I've heard at least one piano teacher advocate the same rough approach.

### Grips: hopefully unifying, training my ear, and reducing thinking

Fareed noted I'm pretty in my head when I play.

Hopefully this grip-oriented approach - which will change eveyrthing about how
I approach single-note soloing, and I *hope* will even help me bridge the gaps
between comping, single-note soloing, and solo guitar (including but not limited
to chord-melody) - can help.

It has to be done with great rhythm. If I get it properly engrained this should
be possible; one of my main impediments is having to think so much about notes
that I don't groove as much as I'd like.

**Transcriptions**

He also thinks I'm at a point where I can gain a lot from transcription; he advises
transcribing licks and phrases rather than solos for now, and bringing all this
back to the grips. This will improve my ear directly, and also my ear-finger
connection. And importantly, it will do it in the context of actual music, and
good rhythmic choices.

### More subdominants

Fareed made a big deal about starting to play lines that indicate where the
changes are *going*, not just where we are now. This is important for lots
of reasons:
- First off, it's just a big part of jazz vocabulary in general
- Second, he noted that it really helps the rhythm section hear where you are
- Third, it gives your lines shape and direction, which will indirectly
  almost certainly improve your time feel and phrasing quite a bit.

Another benefit from my personal perspective is it breaks up static chords,
which might help me stay more "limber" for fast changes elsewhere in the
tune, as well as helping me keep the form better (occasionally the chords that
last a couple measures are tricky for me to count; throwing in some kind of
a tension/resolution makes it easier to count in small chunks).

The main way to do this is to play the secondary dominant ahead of a chord
change. And if you're hanging around on one chord for a bit, you can just
throw in a secondary dominant there too.

He didn't say it but other appraoches are also possible - you could play
a big chromatic run and/or enclosure on a scale tone (especially 3)
or side step (which has other interpretations too, e.g. side-stepping
up on a major 7 could also be thought of as playing the neapolitan).

# 2025-08-08

First thing: I played some bass and reestablished an instinct I already
had which is that I can use dramatically less force than I currently
do. I suspect that
- this is the primary driver of my hand issues
- a major secondary factor is tensing up when I play fast
- it may or may not be exacerbated by hand position (I think my position is at
  least ok-ish, Richard seems happy)

There's an exercise I already have to help with this, which is to practice
playing with super light pressure:
- try to play so light thta it mutes the strings
- try to play just enough to get a note, but make it buzz
- do this *every day*:
  - this is how you'll stay calibrated, because the right amount of pressure 
    is just a tiny bit more than where it buzzes
  - you'll probably also note that the extent to which you play on the fingertips
    affects the amount of force needed. More tip = more bone = less force

## The last masterclasses

### Single-note soloing

Fareed reiterated some points about single-note solo vocab:
- Traditional jazz vocabulary is mostly the blues scale plus chromaticism This
  (and the rhythmic and phrasing vocabularly that goes with it, which is the
  vast majority of the work) is essentially all you need to play anything in
  one tonal center.
  - In terms of how to use it on tunes:
    - For a blues, you play mainly minor blues scale and mix in major for
      some brighter colors
    - For rhythm changes you play mostly major blues / pentatonic and mix in
      minor for some bluesier sounds
    - For a minor tune like Softly you might need to use some harmonic
      minor vocab, but you can think of that as just some (specific) chromatic
      neighbor tones
    - GAS standards will be some combination of the above, and you may need to
      modulate depending on the extent to which the chords imply mode changes
      (and also depending on tempo - at a faster tempo, you can ignore more).
  - In terms of what kind of chromaticism to use:
    - At the simplest level, just use neighbors, chromatic runs connecting
      pentonic notes, and enclosures
    - At a more advanced level and guided by your ear / by transcription, you
      might choose some specific notes to mix in (e.g. harmonic minor
      as discussed above, but other vaguely modal colors can be implied).
      - Eventually I think this sort of thing probably winds up kind of
        beigng essentially the same idea as Chris Fitzgerald's "organic scales"
  - The other thing to always remember is that in jazz, the line between
    major and minor is *always* blurry:
    - you can usually play minor 3 against major or dominant (this is the
      bluesy sound; if you really hold it, it's the sharp 9 sound, which
      he said you really can think of as a flat 3 and sharp three coexisting
    - you can also very often play a sharp 3 on a minor, that just turns
      it into another secondary dominant
    - a consequence: a lot of the "blues scale" vocab described above will
      actually freely intermingle the major and minor blues, or move
      between them frequently for color.
- Bebop and more complex swing vocabulary combines ^^ with more use of
  arpeggios.
  - By this I think he means something more specific, really:
    - simple arpeggios are largely already in the approach above, and are
      pretty vanilla vocabulary, even Louis Armstrong used them
    - I think the bebop-y sound is mainly coming from use of "tension"
      arpeggios, emphasizing either secondary dominants or some other
      sound that plays a similar role against whatever the next chord
      is (which incluses the current chord when the chords aren't moving;
      one of the big things in bebop is to imply chord motion even over
      static harmony) such as a lower / upper chromatic neighbor chord.
    - This was a point he really drove home not today, but in an earlier
      class session and also in my lesson
      - also, my conclusion is that I should focus on the use of minor
        6 / half-diminished shapes to achieve this as my initial priority
  - He also emphasizes that this is not what bebop is all about, bebop
    mixes *some* of this arpeggio vocab with a *lot* of the pentatonic
    and blues + chromatic
    - He also noted it does vary by player; for example he says Bill
      Evans played mostly arpeggios, not so much blues. But he's convinced
      you need to *start* from the blues side.
- Modal jazz is another thing, and is specifically an attempt to *avoid*
  this sound using a while set of approaches including:
  - lots of pattern-based vocabulary, and also triad pairs
  - playing off the 5 or 9 for different color (his "jazz rock" class)
  - plyaing off a half step or a minor third for "outside" sounds

Another note he made is that both the chromaticism in pentatonic playing
and the bebop-y arpeggios are actually very "inside" sounds: the notes
you play might be crunchy but they actually are pushing and pulling the
harmony into place, outlining it even *more* clearly than diatonic playing
does.

The modal sound is actually the more outside sound, even when you aren't
doing something like side-stepping (and when you are it can get very modal
indeed).

Just a side note - chromaticism *can* be very outside if you use atonal
pattern-based vocabulary, but that's not what we're talking about here!

### Comping

The most important thing is guide tones, and building "out"

A lot of the rest of comping is well illustrated by the "walking guitar"
style, which uses:
 - the basic "Freddie Green substituions rules:
   - substitution of dominant for minor
   - substitution of a suspension for dominant
   - leading into any chord (including a static one) with its secondary dominant
 - plus also tritone substution and the use of both 1 and 5 in the bass
to create constant motion ... (I would add that in addition to ^^, you also
can use chromatic neighbors from below, which behave similarly to a secondary
dominant but are totally different notes).

Mimi later made the point that this is the real freddie green sound. The more
static chomping people associate with him is really kind of a special texture,
the sound is really walking guitar where every beat is often a little different.

The classic more charleston-like comping sound is basically the same idea, but
with a more open rhythmic feel:
- Fareed claims that the flat-out majority of what the greats did was just apply
  these ideas, combined with great rhythmic vocabulary, to guide-tone-only lines.
- You can add extensions for color and to make specific chords pop and/or as
  part of "building" your comping behind a soloist, but he specifically emphasizes
  that most of the classic players didn't do this *most* of the time, only some
  of the time (which actually makes it more effective when you pull it out!)
- If you do add extensions, you ideally want to think melodically about them, the
  extensions are effectively creating a small chord melody in your comping line.

Later, Mimi noted that if you're playing with a piano, one effective thing can be
to actually add in the "chomp" style comping, often up higher and softer than you would
play it if you were using it as a "primary" accompanist... I'll add that doing that
selectively could actually help you mark the form.
...The two other options, other than laying out, are:
  - find some kind of riff that can lay on top of the main groove
  - play mostly textures "on 1", possibly with more arpeggiated / slow-strumed style
    to really add color.


### Some more miscellaneous musical things

Mimi's number one advice for solo guitar: focus on the time. You have to keep
great time, or it all falls apart.

Mimi actually plays with her thumb freely floating below the neck surprisingly
often; she only does it on higher frets, but she does it before she runs out
of neck.

The lazy bird and four on six progressions might be particularly useful to
work on a bit; Mimi actually likes to use the lazy bird progression as a
substitution sometimes.

### Career

In jazz Mimi would say success is 50% skills, 50% social media.

In pop the social media is even more important, perception is key for an audience.

Being easy to work with and nice to be around of course makes a big difference.
Reputation is key with other players

If you wanted to break into music and you are able to mingle, you should find a
booking agent before a manager.
