## Ideas from Mimi's Masterclass

Mimi likes to construct counterpoint by using
arpeggios to connect a sort of low and high voice.

When in doubt, she likes to aim to land on the 3 of
any new chord; you can do the same thing with any
extension note, but especially in solo playing the 3
gives you a great scaffold.

Something Mimi and Ned both emphasize is thinking
in shapes. Mimi considers connecting all the tools
in one map important "everywhere I am, the entire
harmonic universe is". Pretty similar to how Ned
talks about orienting himself around the root chords.

Byzantine / Hungarian Minor: it's typically called
Hungarian minor when it starts off the minor root;
it's called Byzantine when it starts off the 5. Mimi
essientially rediscovered it when working on Caravan,
inspired by the B natural in the melody... it makes
a kind of sense against the Db7 too, that's another
way of thinking how it fits against the vamp.
- She likes to use it as a way to pull some extra
  color out on a minor blues sometimes; this is
  interesting since minor blues can be a bit bland.
- It's always usable on a harmonic minor vamp, it's
  just a blues substitution, but the Byzantine off
  the 5 (or the harmonic minor) is also an alternative
  to the normal altered scale.

Her suggestions for arpeggios:
- Start by focusing on just a couple of positions
  (not sure I'd take this advice, it's hard to apply
  in context if you don't learn enough to stay
  in a position across changes)
- Play the arpeggios over tunes. This one is great
  advice, and I don't do it enough! I really should
  take this idea and apply it to all the techniques,
  like Ned's dyads or CF's organic scales, as well -
  the idea is that straight 8th note runs that are
  mechanical are a good way to internalize both
  the sound and shape.
- Ideally, spend at least some of your time trying
  to practice the arpeggio where you target landing
  on 3 of each new chord, which will always outline
  the harmony well, and it's typically not part of
  the previous chord (this idea applies to bass and
  comping too, Ned emphasized this)
  - Although playing a common tone is obviously also
    an option, sort of the opposite one, that you
    can use in both comping and soloing, and even
    as a bass pedal
- Her main exercise is to just arpeggiate up and
  down alternate chords, but she does work on
  skip-note playing which is another leap-y motion
  and a bit closer to Ned's pattern.

## Fareed's Masterclass

### Time feel of the ensemble

His first observation on time feel:
- The jazz march (Freddie Green, walking bass,
  high hat) is a march and wants to rush, it
  should be ahead, at the top of the beat
- The modern comping rhythms should be more in
  the middle, it's like glue and helps control
  the rush
- The melody and soloist often play behind
... This leads to a fat beat, the out-of-sync-ness
is part of how swing gets its feel, because it creates
a thick texture.

### How to work on comping

Fareed's approach to comping:
- Start with guide tones, the two pairs of voicings
  - Ideally, learn both voicings on strings 3 and 4, but it's very good to
    learn strings 4 and 5 up high on the neck as well, and for me probably also
    strings 2 and 3 just for good measure
- Within that schema, try to practice comping focusing on rhythm so it's
  interesting:
  - Fareed likes to actually vocalize a drum part while he does this
- Then, add bass notes and practice Freddie Green style... ideally be able to
  play both 1 and 5 note on strings 5 / 6 comfortably, which also will
  naturally lead into a 2-feel or bossa bassline
  - With the freddie green, make sure to leave space by muting
    the upbeats. And try to push the rhythm, you want top of the
    beat
- Then add extensions, first one and then two

While you do this, keep in mind a few things:
- You can play hits a half step up *or* down to accent things
- You can suspend or hit a secondary dominant to accent things
- You can use moving extensions to accent things

Eventually, start working on adding melody.
- You can potentially play melody above the guide tones, as chord-melody,
  but this can be a bit challenging.
- Fareed and Mimi both like the approach where you hit the chords now
  and then while mostly playing single note meldoy.
- This is obviously good to do with tunes, but also improv. And if you
  use various forms of restricted practice for the improv, it's a way
  to "glue together" the two "strands" of practicing tunes a bit more,
  by working on accompaniment voicings and melodic ideas together... this
  is one way to get more plugged in to Mimi's "harmonic universe" at each
  location.

### Freddie Green chord theory

Freddie green's rules of basic chord substitution:
- Anything can be a dominant, unless it clashes w/melody
- Any chord can have a secondary dominant, often but not always played as a
  pickup ... a half step up *is* a secondary dominant (a tritone sub)
- Any dominant can have it's minor / suspension played (often over
  half the original chord duration rather than as a pickup)
  - The idea that the minor part of a II-VI is just the suspension is
    a key idea to Fareed; it also might be a useful unifying concept
    when exploring Maiden Voyage-type tunes.

An exercise Fareed likes to emphasize the dominant idea is play a
I-IV-vii-iii-vi-ii-V-I but use all dominants, so it's just a tritone
moving down (with the IV and vii the same). This idea is interesting
in that you can apply it to other progressions and use it as a scaffold,
then optionally add any combination of non-dominant tonalities or
suspensions in to break up the tritones a bit:
- For example, it's already basically a back-cycled circle of fifths
  starting on #VI. Maybe use the minor for the #IV (i.e. supension of
  the VII) when you do this.
- But you could apply the same idea to rhythm changes, coltrane changes,
  Great American Songbook standards, etc.

### A couple more observations on comping

Fareed uses a lot of both tritone subs and more general chromatic
motion (both upper and lower neighbor chords) when he plays what Randy
Vincent likes to call "walking guitar", i.e. Freddie-Green style rhythm
but with a lot of motion. He also mixes in some upstrokes here and there,
very similar to how bass players hit the odd 8th note when walking.

For bossa, Fareed thinks playing just the shells is fine... this is the
default approach I should probably take for now in 4ths tuning since
it's kind of tricky to grab extensions.

But in addition, when Fareed was comping latin feel, he used a lot
of repeated bass notes, not always alternating, so he obviously thinks
that is fine, and I can use the same idea. You can potentially use
a combination of suspensions, moving extensions, or chord substitution
to add movement if it gets boring.

### Melodic language

Fareed is a huge fan of starting off pentatonics. The starting
point is to play major or minor pentatonic, and try to play a mostly
rhythmic idea using just couple notes (a bit like Adam Maness's "take
your snare solo" idea). You can combine the pentatonics and add
the blues scale note to add some more flavor.

His rough advice over what to default to:
- On rhythm changes and a lot of GAS tunes, start with the major
  pentatonic and go minor when you want some bluesy feel.
- On bluesy tunes, start with the minor pentatonic and go major
  when you want to add some jazzier snazz.

A very easy way to add just a bit of bebop-ism on top of this
is to play some enclosures *around* the pentatonic notes.

From there, if we want to lean into pentatonics you can do lots
of things:
- To get a more open sound, play a pentatonic off the five or
  the 9 (in major this will sound lydian, in minor it will sound
  dorian - think Footprints; note that it's pretty closely
  connected to So What chords).
- To play a more outside, take the idea that there's a minor third
  connection (as in, Gm and Jm both work on a J) and extend it
  to the full cycle of thirds (so for a blues in J, you can
  borrow from the Em and Km pentatonics).
- You can also obviously side-step.
  - Side-stepping down is mostly crunch
  - Side-stepping up can potentially imply other things; side-stepping
    up to the bIIma pentatonic is a bit neapolitan sounding, side-stepping
    to the bIImi pentatonic is also potentially implying an altered scale.

All the fancier pentatonics need to be grounded in the safer ones first,
you've got to be able to really hear it to play it successfully and
musically.

Similarly, pulling in all the classic bebop material (more enclosures,
arpeggios, etc) is great but you generally want to sprinkle it in
on top of the pentatonics (or quadratonics or organic scales - whatever
your basic "simple" building block is, doesn't have to be a pentatonic).
The bebopisms are great, but you can't really build a whole solo out
of them, it's mentally exhausting and wouldn't sound that good anyway.

## Mimi Quotes

"Guides are only Guides" / "A guide is merely a guide"

## Our homework

Blue Bossa - focus on guide tone lines, with a secondary focus
on on bass lines and extensions.

Try to explore the idea of substituting dominants, adding secondary
dominants, and suspending chords as well if we can.

## Fareed's master class

Diminished chords: they don't really exist - they are functioning
as dominant chords. Your task is to figure out what dominant.
- An ascending passing diminished is typically functioning like the
  dominant a third below.
- A descending passing diminished is leading the same *direction* as
  a secondary dominant, but the notes are actually like the parallel
  dominant of the target (which is almost always a minor chord). You often
  could sub it with the secondary dominant, although it depends on the
  melody.

Half diminished chords: they do exist, but it's sometimes more productive to
think of them as the minor 6 off of 3.
- This also implies that for half diminished, 1 and 5 will work about as well
  as 3 and 7 for outlining the chord.
- But if there's a bass you ideally wouldn't double, so actually either 3 and 7
  with the flat 5 is probably a better idea in an ensemble context.

When practicing guide tone playing, a couple more things to try:
- Sing the roots as you play - this is really important to actually
  contextualize the comping, you wouldn't play like this w/o a bass!
- Sing the melody as you play, that will also usually help plus it's
  very important to be 
- Another useful exercise is to play a 5 in the bass, which is a better
  choice than 1 if you're playing with a bass player so you don't
  double the root, and maybe sing 1.
  - Ned would disagree about doubling, since his stance is that
    you get a nice 5 from overtones. So you can file away both ideas.

Another thing to practice: three-note skip voicings with guide tones and
an extension played with a gap string (so play only the upper note of a 4-note
voicing with extensions). Reasons:
- This gives you more choices for extension color tones - esp in cases like a
  minor where you might not really want a 13 but a 9 is good
- the spacing of the voicing will have an airier quality, so it can be really
  nice if you want a more whimsical sound
- it also is a great tool to have down for chord melody

Next Fareed went through embelleshing Blue Bossa using dominant substitutions
and voice leading. Then he demonstrated how when playing lines you can use the
same idea to create a lot of jazzy sounds - he demonstrated basically playing
a different chord every 2 beats, where if you're hanging out on a chord for
a while you just jump to its secondary dominant and back again, and then you
play a secondary dominant as a pickup to each next chord. Eventually you
want to do this by ear and potentially hear the subdominant notes as colors,
but as an exercise this works well. You can apply the same idea using
other sounds too like the neapolitan or a secondary subdominant (which will
kind of suspend then resolve) or the parallel dominant instead of the secondary
dominant.

When you have a lot of time, you can throw in not only a secondary dominant
but also it's suspension; on Blue Bossa Fareed likes the second measure of
Cm heading into Lm to demo this - play Fm->J7 as a kind of pickup to the Lm.

Something Fareed likes to do on the second bar of Kma in Blue Bossa is go
to H (could be H7 but he usually does major, either works here). This can
be thought of two ways:
- It's a tritone lead-in to the Dm7b5, which is actually fairly common
  (and is the tritone sub of the parallel dominant lead in, which is also
  common - note that this is similar in function to a descending
  passing chromatic as described above!
- It's also a suspension of the Kma, so it makes good sense in terms of
  where you're coming *from* (if you used an Edim or D7, it would feel
  like more of a non-sequitur).
- You can also play a measure with two beats of Hma and two of D7, which
  can even more smoothly mark the shift back to Cm

On the turnaround, Fareed likes to throw in an an A7, which is a subdominant
for the Dhd but also turns the turnaround into a typical a (dorian) VI-ii-V-i.

Adding all these substitutions with guide tones is a big part of how you can
fill in a solo guitar setup 

Fareed likes to practice these ideas in weird keys and awkward spots on the
guitar, especially low positions where you'll be forced to pick voicings
carefully.

### A couple notes on right hand technique

Benson-style or normal style pick grip are both common and work well
### Substitutions

The most common substitutions other than for dominants are minor
thirds

### Some additional thoughts

Don't play what you don't hear. When you approach jazz, imagine you had
been playing blues for years first - that's what most of the OGs did.

When you comp, be able to hold the melody in your head (not a huge issue
for me ususally, but the same principle applies to bass lines which is
much harder for me).
... Mimi notes that that's true for soling too, hold the melody in mind.

The rhythm is the most important thing:
- You can't really practice it directly in the practice room:
  - You can do exercises (think Romain Pillon and Eric Peralta's exercises)
  - You can transcribe rhythms and get them into your vocabulary
  - Maybe most importantly you can play along with recordings to work on *time*
- But to really do it, you have to play with other people
  - You also have to understand your role, your part. "All modern American
    music is based on African stylings, and African music is part-based"

## Mimi's masterclass

To avoid injury, Mimi's recommendations are:
- Get checkpointed on technique from time to time
  - She noted my posture was bad at one point, although that was an odd situation
    since I was trying not to hit David. Still, be mindful of this.
  - Her point is also validated by my thumb issues a few months back - Richard saw
    right away what I was doing that was weird
- Do warm ups, which for her means:
  - Mobilizations of the hand and shoulder
  - Stretches of the hand and shoulder
  - Make sure your hands are actually warm enough, not cold

Mimi suggests practicing pauses. This is similar to a big thing Charlie focuses on
in solos, but Mimi says it's valuable even in solo guitar where we tend to fill in
a lot, it can build tension (plus, it gives you a breather and a great opportunity
to take a solo in a different direction). It also helps you work on your time, which
needs to be held through pauses!

To get bebop language, Mimi recommends mainly two things:
- Study bebop heads, especially Parker heads, and incorporate that material
- Transcribe - ideally full solos, but snippets are really the building blocks
  of language so you don't have to do full solos
  - The main benefit of full solos is that then you can play along and work on your
    time feel as well as see an example of the "arc" of a solo.
