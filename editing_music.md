# Editing music

I tried to learn lillypond but got frustrated; I'll try again someday
but for now it seems like abc notation is really the most useful thing:
it's pretty compact, widely supported, and parsable by music21 (which
means I can write in abc and very easily export for prgrammatic manipulation,
including sending to MuseScore).

There are tons of online editors; many of them are good but so far the best
one for actually dumping out sheet music seems to be Michale Eksin's free
tools at https://michaeleskin.com/abctools/abctools.html; this one can
direct print PDFs, and it renders chord symbols pretty nicely.

The one at https://editor.drawthedots.com/ is also really useful - it renders
a decent-looking score (but not in pdf format), and has a built-in player
that can be handy for sanity checking.
