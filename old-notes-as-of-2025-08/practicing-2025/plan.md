# 2025 practice plan

My goal for 2025 is to make measurable progress across a number
of areas, using a kind of matrix approach to learn more by
doing more.

I want to make progress on 4 instruments:
- Guitar
- Bass
- Piano
- Voice

I also want to make progress in the 3 jammable genres:
- Jazz
- Bluegrass
- Blues

## Why so much stuff?

My belief is that I can do more my spreading my focus across
instruments because the different perspectives will help me learn
faster, and because it lets me more easily pivot around physical
limitations that I've often hit when trying to ramp up on guitar alone.

But to do this successfully, I really need to have enough focus to get
real practice and progress in, instead of falling back to the kind of
exhausted noodling that I often have in the past.

## Reading Piano

My main focus on piano is to build my reading ability and some
late-beginner repertoire.

My motivations for this are:
- First, that I need a disciplined way to build coordination in order
  to study jazz piano, and I might as well use the existing books.
- Second, that reading piano can help me develop both my mental model
  of music and my reading ability for guitar, faster than I could probably
  build them by actually reading guitar
- Third, that if I can get to solid intermediate level, I will have access
  to the tools I need to get more out of piano later:
  - At a late intermediate level, I can already learn performable pop
    arrangements that would be usable at a gig if there's a piano ready
  - In addition, at that point I'll have much easier access to both books
    and transcriptions for studying jazz and blues at more advanced levels

With this in mind, advancing my piano skills to an intermediate level is
a top priority - especially for the winter quarter since (a) I'll be
studying with Jono and (b) I can't really sign up for more ensembles given
our vacation.


This goal - of building piano skills - is the area whare I need the most
ogranization in my practice. It's much too easy to either go too shallow,
just reading a bunch of music poorly, or go too deep and focus too much
on just a couple tunes. What I really need, to build the kind of broad
skill set I want fast, is to learn tunes to a minimal viable level and
then move on for my "main" practice focus, but to also have a big backlog
of tunes that I am regularly playing through to review (and setting aside
serious practice time to clean up sloppiness if needed).


## Jazz Piano

I'm not sure how much focus I will have on playing jazz piano, but I
do want to work on basic 'comping and use this as a lever to be learning
tunes.

My exact plans remain to be seen, but the idea is to focus on very basic
skills, but learn lots of tunes in lots of keys.

In general I think I need to learn each tune in:
 - 3 singable keys, with the primary one being a 'hard' key
 - the standard key
 - a fourth above the standard key (so that I can translate to bari)

Piano will not be my only tool here - my intent is to use both piano
and bass (but not guitar) for this.

# Blues: guitar and bass

I want to learn all the top 50 or so blues standards by ear this
year.

# Bluegrass

My exact bluegrass plans remain to be seen.

My instinct is to start out by learning, from sheet music, all of the tunes
in SFPL books and to use this as my primary guitar reading for Q1.

While I'm at it I need to pick 3-4 standards I like enough to push to
a performance level, and then try to sit in on a jam session!

... After I have 3-4 tunes + a bunch of reading practice, I'll need to start
learning bluegrass tunes by ear. The initial focus on reading is just out
of convenience - it makes some sense to build my sense of idioms by reading
at first, and I can focus my ear work on blues for a little while.
