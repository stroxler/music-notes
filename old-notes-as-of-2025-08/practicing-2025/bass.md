## Intonation

My primary issue remains intonation. I'm hoping I can improve
largely just by practicing and checking my intonation, but I do
still believe that a bunch of specific exercises could help:
- Noodling with lots of intonation checks:
  - Octaves down on high D and A are especially useful
  - Octaves down on high E and B can also be handy
  - Octave up on G is useful
- Doing play-alongs!!
  - Especially at first, playing with a recording of the actual bassline;
    I can record basslines on piano or whatever, but in addition the books
    actually have recorded basslines (an added bonus: it acts like a metronome!)
  - In addition, I eventually need to start recording comping and using
    a *different* part on the same *chords* to check my intonation, which
    is more realistic
- Practicing the "include open strings" style of flexi-position playing
  - In particular, playing at the 6th fret works *really* well
  - Note that this isn't just a practice technique: by using this in
    *performance* I can probably both check my intonation and avoid fatigue
- Writing out basslines to sing with for my favorites
  - By writing out basslines and drilling the same way, I can probably
    do a better job of building muscle memory
  - In addition, I think the singing can be slightly helpful for staying in tune


## Reading

Both the Fuqura and the Mooney books are fantastic reading material, both have
playalongs.

Mooney's playalongs can be found at
https://constructingwalkingjazzbasslines.com/collections/all (check page 2 as well)
... he also has a youtube channel with some video lessons at
https://www.youtube.com/@jazzbasslines12keys/playlists

The Ed Fuqura book has play-alongs, and I think I may make it my top priority.

NOTE: be sure to do the reading exercises both on BG and on u-bass, it's important
that I am improving at both!

## Free-form and semi-structured practice

A top priority for me is to use bass as one of my primary instruments to learn
standards. For that, I need to do both some amount of free-form practice just
'noodling' against actual chord changes, and also have a more systematic approach.

The noodling is pretty easy, I can just practice using the various techniques I'm
learning from books in an unstructured way.

For structured practice, eventually I'll need a big bag of tricks, but for starters
I think I can try following Ed Fuqura's advice here:
https://www.talkbass.com/threads/really-learning-a-tune.304843/

His recommendation is to:
- learn the melody
- play non-rooted arpeggios using proximity - this is his biggest emphasis
- play half notes, trying to emphasize the *melody* rather than a vanilla two-feel
  - eventually work toward smaller denominations like quarter and eighth notes,
    with different accent patterns, for the melody bit

He has specific advice for how to start combining these approaches, eventually
the goal is to be able to smoothly switch between playing the actual tune melody
vs improvided melodic bassline vs arpeggiated chords.

Note that he doesn't mention playing roots or a vanilla rooted bassline; I assume
he considers this important (his book does!) but he figures folks are already getting
plenty of practice at it :)

## Library Books

There are several library books worth looking at again, I have a list of them elsewhere.

But I think they can mostly wait, I have enough material to practice already; the only
ones that I would seriously consider borrowing right now are the Friedland books (the
one I have looked at so far broke things down *very* systematically which was nice).

## Online lessons

I haven't done much research yet, but:
- there are several online video and written lesson sites recommended (mostly more guitar-oriented)
- there are a *lot* of folks who post play-along videos of jazz; this could be a fantastic
  resource as I get better and need more reading material than just the books I have
