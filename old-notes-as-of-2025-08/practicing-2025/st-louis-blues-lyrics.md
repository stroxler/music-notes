Lyrics for interlude (standard ones are too female to work):

St Louis man gives her diamond rings
All I can give her, is these songs I sing
Weren't for his porche and his fancy shoes
I would't be here, a cryin' the blues


(alternative for the last line: I wouldn't have these st louis blues... I
don't like those b/c they're too repetitive with the start of the next
12 bars)
