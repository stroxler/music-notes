### Method books

- Jazz Piano Fundamentals I, Jeremy Siskind. `SCORE 786.3 Si82j`
  - Very good book; basic enough that I maybe don't need to purchase
    it to get the benefit, I can just check it out a few times over
    the next year.
- Blues Piano A-Z, Jeremy Siskind. `SCORE 786.3 Si82b`
  - Quality book, covers both jazz and other takes on the blues.
    A bit more in the spirit of the Jazz Hanon series, themed around
    etudes rather than fundamental drills and theory.
- Jazz-Blues Piano, Mark Harrison. `SCORE 786.3 H2471j`
  - I got this because the author has a different book recommended
    online. The content seems pretty good, maybe a little bit
    more advanced than the two Siskind books above; I'd try it again
    sometime later in 2024 after I've advanced some on piano.

### Repertoire books for jazz

- The Jazz Piano Solos series by Hal Leonard. `SCORE 786.4 J3397 V.<n>`
  - These look promising, but they are late intermediate so out of
    reach for me until at least late 2024. They also do include some
    impractical things like 10ths, but not too often.
  - There are a *lot* of these books (e.g. Cocktail Piano is v 31).
