# Exercises for near bedtime

Close to bed I need to be careful of overstimulating
myself, but rote drills can be a good use of time.

Some examples of what would *not* be a good idea:
- Working on tunes. They tend to get stuck in my head.
- Open-ended improvisation exercises, they get me overstimulated

Some examples of what typically is pretty safe to do before bed:
- Chord voicing drills: short progressions, often in a modulation loop
- Various scale-oriented single-line improvisation drills, e.g.
  - scales themselves, including scale shifting or modulation
  - scale-based patterns, for example
    - interval and arpeggio drills
    - more generally, digital pattern based rills
    - enclosure patterns, including both diatonic and chromatic
    - pentatonic patterns
  - ... the key thing is that to be bedtime-safe, the drills should
    remain relatively mechanical. They can sound good, but I shouldn't
    give myself enough freedom to get excited.

Some more borderline stuff:
- Sight reading or transposing music that isn't performance
  material (etudes and such)
- Reviewing tunes that I'm working on memorizing in a relaxed way
- Rhythmic vocabulary drills. I say this is borderline, as opposed to
  chord voicings and scale patterns being safe, because rhythms tend
  to be more exciting and more prone to earworms.
- Constrainted improvisation exercises; the more free they are the
  less bedtime-safe they are :)
