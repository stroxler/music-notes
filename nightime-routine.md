# Exercises for near bedtime

Close to bed I need to be careful of overstimulating
myself, but rote drills can be a good use of time.


## Drilling chord progression snippets

My preference is to do this following modulations;
- on guitar it's most useful short-term to focus on three-note voicings in the
  lower-middle string set, but drop-2 and drop-3 are also valuable.
- on piano, it's most useful to focus on simple voicings:
  - 3 7 RH with root LH (or root + 5 bassline in 2)
  - rootless 3 7 9 5 and 7 3 5 9 comping voicings

## Drilling melodic things

On piano, for now focus on running scales in the RH while playing
root or 2nd inversion 3 and 4 note voicings, or basslines in 2. For
now, don't try to change keys in the middle, I need to get the basic
independence and fingerings in my hands first.

On guitar, there are tons of things to do; for now:
 - drill intervals; all of them but especially 4ths
 - drill enclosures and scale shifts (not ready for this on piano)
 - get more drills from Jens Larsen, his drills are pretty great
   and musical.
