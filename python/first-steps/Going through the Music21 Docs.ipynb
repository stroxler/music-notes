    "on lots of topics I would need to learn to deal with finer details of music, especially solo building:\n",

    "I also skipped parts of the docs that seem more relevant to analysis than to generating music.\n",
    "But all of these might still be useful - taking the corpus and analyzing it to break things\n",
    "down could very well be a way to create abstract patterns for generation.\n",
    "  - [chordify](https://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/usersGuide/usersGuide_09_chordify.html), which\n",
    "    flattens all the combinations of tones in a score into chords which are easier to\n",
    "    analyze programmatically.\n",
    "  - [example 1](https://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/usersGuide/usersGuide_10_examples1.html) using\n",
    "    chordify to analyze progressions from the corpus.\n",
    "  - [example 2](https://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/usersGuide/usersGuide_20_examples2.html) does some\n",
    "    slightly more involved analyses than example 1.\n",
    "  - [Roman numeral analysis](https://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/usersGuide/usersGuide_23_romanNumerals.html),\n",
    "    which depends on both chords and keys.\n",
    "  - [example 3](https://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/usersGuide/usersGuide_30_examples3.html), a more\n",
    "    involved analysis. Some of what's going on here probably would be relevant to analyzing\n",
    "    a jazz solo actually - more so than example 2 certainly. It's really cool and I should come\n",
    "    back to it later - it's just not what I want to *start* with :)\n",
    "  - [trees](https://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/usersGuide/usersGuide_61_trees.html) seem cool from both\n",
    "    a music analysis and software design point of view, but I don't think I need them yet.\n",
    "  - [derivations - transforms reified](https://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/usersGuide/usersGuide_17_derivations.html)\n",
    "    It's kind of cool how this is designed, but I am not immediately seeing a use for this so skipping for now,\n",
    "    can come back to it; the basics of derivations were covered elsewhere anyway.\n",
    "  - [mistakes](https://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/developerReference/startingOver.html) is an interesting\n",
    "    read; probably most important if I decided to try to make my own little library based on some\n",
    "    combination of music21, Euterpea, overtone + leipzig, or other libraries.\n",
    "    - Making a Rust library focused on immutable data would be pretty interesting if I could figure\n",
    "      out how to bind it in Python; it would almost certainly be fast compared to music21 and I\n",
    "      think trying to do this sort of thing from Haskell or Ocaml is natural."
