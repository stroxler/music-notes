### Method books

- Jazz Piano Fundamentals I, Jeremy Siskind. `SCORE 786.3 Si82j`
  - Very good book; basic enough that I maybe don't need to purchase
    it to get the benefit, I can just check it out a few times over
    the next year.
- Blues Piano A-Z, Jeremy Siskind. `SCORE 786.3 Si82b`
  - Quality book, covers both jazz and other takes on the blues.
    A bit more in the spirit of the Jazz Hanon series, themed around
    etudes rather than fundamental drills and theory.
- Jazz-Blues Piano, Mark Harrison. `SCORE 786.3 H2471j`
  - I got this because the author has a different book recommended
    online. The content seems pretty good, maybe a little bit
    more advanced than the two Siskind books above; I'd try it again
    sometime later in 2024 after I've advanced some on piano.
