# Major 7 b5 (and #11) chords

My fellow ensemble members in my jazz group love to use
a few flavors of this chord in ways that don't match up
with typical "classical" jazz sounds, so I wanted to gather
notes on:
- ways to think of the function of the chord, which depends
  a lot on the context it's used in
- examples of tunes using it in various ways, which is important
  because by listening and maybe transcribing I can get these
  chords in my ear.


## Tonic and subdominant chords (lydian mode)

The most obvious use of a Ma7#11 is as the VI chord in major, or the bVI in
minor. These are subdominant chords, diatonic to the key signature, and it will
sound absolutely natural.

In this setting, playing the #11 is just a way to add some extra color (either
to comping or to solo lines) relative to playing the bare major 7 chord or one
of the two obvious pentatonics (from the root or 5). If you're playing
pentatonic licks, you can play off of the 2 (i.e. a D major pentatonic against
Cma7#11) if you want to lean even more into the lydian sound.

This same idea can be extended in two ways:
- you can usually get away with using the #11 and a lydian vocabulary on
  the *tonic*, assuming (for comping) that the melody doesn't use a suspension
  to 4 and (for soling) that your rhythm section doesn't try "planing" over
  a suspension or subdominant sound. It's usually a fairly mild sound; it can
  be particularly nice as a way to end a piece or section.
- you can borrow from the minor to play a bVIma7#11 as a borrowed subdominant;
  this is going to sound relatively "outside" and there are actually a few
  ways to think of it:
  - obviously it's a borrowed subdominant, how I introduced it
  - if you omit the 5, it's actually the same *notes* as a V phrygian, which
    is what I like to call a semi-dominant chord that is sort of both dominant
    and subdominant at the same time.
  - If you play it over the 7 (as in, e.g., an Abma7b5 over a G) then it
    actually *is* a G phrygian, which can be spelled other ways too such
    G7susb9 or Bb7/G
    - aside: the spelling Bb7/Gb, which Mark Levine uses, is a little weird
      because there's no Bb, it's really a rootless Bb13/G. Although if you do
      include the Bb it will work fine, then it's a G7susb9#9 which is kind of
      leaning into the same "altered subdominant" sound coming from C minor
      (and obviously Bb is in most of the scales you'd play against Abma7b5).
  - ... so it's basically an "altered suspended" sound that you can think of
    as having elements of both subdominant and altered dominant sounds.
  - note that bVIma7 often will resolve to V, which is what you'd sort of
    expect of a subdominant.
    - It will kind of behave like a tritone substitution for IImi in that case,
      and in fact it's outlined for one beat by a typical walking bassline
      anyway!
    - for an example of a tune that uses this *explicitly*, "Blue in Green"
      does (Bbma7#11 -> A7alt) although the effect isn't as pronounced because
      it's headed to D minor rather than D major.

## The VII ma7b5 chord

Jens Larsen has a lesson that explores Ma7b5 more statically by looking
at all the chords it can sub for (his video is more focused on when you
can use solo lines *derived* from the arpeggio vs the chord per se, but
that's beside the point).

In it, he points out that a Bma7b5 chord is actually spelling the most
important notes of a G7alt:
- the 3 (which is the root of Bma)
- the #5/b13 (which is the 3 of Bma)
- the 7 (which is the #11 of Bma)
- the #9 (which is the 7 of Bma)

As a result, Bma7b5 is actually just Galt/B, and is very much a dominant
chord against C (major or minor).

If you play the normal 5 (so F#) that muddies things quite a bit according
to classical harmony, but it actually still works similarly, which seems
like it can be explained in two not-mutually-exclusive ways:
- it's just an extra "outside" note that resolves chromatically, giving
  us more crunch and more modal interchange flavor
- it's also the minor blues note, and we're already playing an altered
  dominant sound borrowed from minor so in some ways the F# just "blueses
  it up" some more, since you can pretty much always play a blues scale
  of the current implied key and it will sort of work.

Aside: This is also an idea you can use to get some not-just-chromatic ideas
when faced with a series of ascending maj7 chords (e.g. Charlie Mingus's
Opus 4) - if you lean into the #11 before switching, you'll get something
that feels more like a dominant -> tonic resolution.

## The bIIma7 chord

This one is really important becuase it pops up a *ton* in my fellow
ensemble members' compositions.

In classical theory, this is considered a subdominant chord which wants
to resolve to V. I think this actually does happen - I've seen quite a few
cases where people take the chord down a tritone to a 7 chord... one example
is Ama7 -> D7 which Charlie Mingus uses a couple times in
"Sue's Changes" and also in the 

An alternative and equivalent way of viewing it in this setting is as a
tritone substitution for the Vsus chord (which in the process again
outlines a more altered / almost-phrygian sound, but it's even a little
more outside than phrygian because it has the b5 of V - this is spicy, but
it's also normal to play on an altered dominant). As a result,
the movement bIIma7b5 -> V is sort of just behaving like a suspension
and resolution, which is of course also how a normal II -> V behaves;
the difference is that we've moved practically all the *other* notes so
we're getting a strongly "altered" sound.
- Note that you *could* actually go from this to the bII7, at which point
  you'd much more clearly be outlining a dominant suspension to regular
  via tritone sub. But that's not usually actually how this is used, it
  usually goes either to V (neapolitan classic cadence) or to I
  (neapolitan plagal cadence)

But in addition to resolving a tritone down, which suggests a
Neapolitan bII -> V, I actually see it pop up a lot and resolving to *I* in
both major *and* minor. This is exactly what my colleage's compositions do.
In that case, it's actually behaving kind of like the opposite suspension...

... what do I mean by this? Remember that a G7sus is really pretty much
the same as a Csus, which is pretty much the same as an Fadd9. So
subdominant, suspended tonic, and suspended dominant are all kind of the
same sound. So when we play a G7sus to C, which is sort of a standard
cadence, it's also kind of the same as an F to C which is a Plagal
cadence.

...if we then accept bIIma7#11 as a borrowed neapolitan subdominant, then
bIIma7 -> I(ma or mi) is really just a plagal movement, and also behaves
a lot like just suspending and resolving.

And since a subdominant is also kind of the same as a suspension of the tonic,
it's not super surprising that you can also choose to leave the bass alone
(so play bIIma7#11 over it's 7, which is the root of the key) at which point
it's more clearly acting like an "altered tonic suspension" in terms of bass.

It's been hard for me to wrap my ear around this sound. I need to do some
listening for sure. Here are some starting points:
- "Deluge" by Wayne Shorter leans really heavily into this because
  it "resolves" the main melody to the minor root and goes to bIIma
  at the same time. The sound is *really* cool and maybe a good starting
  point.
- "Beatrice" uses it in both directions in minor *and* major and the
  sound is pretty clear cut as in Deluge because it just goes up and
  back down again
- "You Stepped Out of a Dream" uses it repeatedly in both directions,
  although things are modulating fast enough that it isn't crystal clear
- "A Child Is Born" uses this sound too, to some extent but it spells
  the chords differently: it goes Bbma -> Ebm/Bb -> Bbma. But
  Ebm/Bb, if you play it as a minor 9, has the notes D#, F, F#, and A#
  which are all the components of a Bma#11 except the B!

There may also be some similarities to the harmony/melody interaction
in "Night And Day"... it's not obvious to me just looking at the latter,
but there's an Fm -> Em which I suppose you could actually think
of as playing Dbma -> Cma with the 3rds in the bass. My ensemble director
and members have specifically called that tune out as being similar
to some of the tunes using bIIma7 -> Ima.
- ... "Night and Day" is also interesting in that it gets to the Fm by way of
  F#mib5 which is a little bit of an unusual jump straight from Cma, and
  probably one that I should get better at.
- I suppose if we think of IVm -> tonic as being a similar sound to
  bIIma -> tonic then there actually are quite a few more tunes that
  have that kind of effect. I bet that bIIma works well as a sub for
  IVm in a lot of those tunes!

### bonus: bIIma7#11 as a final chord

Finally, it's also popular to *end* a tune (either in major or minor)
on the bIIma7#11.

In that context I think it again functions like an extra-crunchy suspension,
the sound is a little like ending on a sus chord except it also contains most
of the "extra" notes from the altered dominant. But you don't have to think
as hard about what to solo over it when you'r just using it to end :)

### Phrygian modes and chords, and relationships to maj7b5 chords:

Since there's also some connection to Phrygian chords and scales, you can potentially
find even more resources by looking at lessons covering and examples of Phrygian
sounds. It actually pops up in several ways:
- a neapolitan chord is actually aligned with a phrygian mode built off the root,
  so phrygian vs the key signature is a modal interchange you can lean into for
  bIIma7 <-> I movements.
- the bVIma7b5 is basically the same as a V phrygian, i.e. an *altered* V7sus.
- The VIIma7b5 is actually a bVII phrygian... that's probably not the most
  obvious way to think of it (it'san altered V off the 3rd, which is really what
  you'll tend to hear), but it is in some ways like a "backdoor phrygian"

... while I'm thinking of phrygian, it's worth noting one other funny connection: I
remember OpenStudio folks mentioning that E7 resolves to C, it's the last of the four
dominants in the G7 diminished cycle. What's interesting is that E *phrygian*, which
is an altered suspended E dominant, is actually *diatonic* in C! In fact, the Mark
Levine book uses G7/E as his *intro* to phrygians. He has it resolve to A, but you
could make it go to C instead.

### The bVI minor chord

This isn't at all a maj7#11 chord obviously, but it actually maybe comes up in some
of the same contexts, and is loosely connected:
- The bVI minor chord, if it resolves to I (especially to a minor I) functions
  like a twist on an altered dominant: it is the b9, 3, and b13 of the
  V chord:
  - If you play it as minor 6, that's the 7 of V so it's even more dominant
  - If you play it as a minor major 7 that's the root
  - If you play it as a minor 7, then you're playing the blue note of the
    resolving minor (this is like playing the natural 5 in a VIImaj7#11, as
    discussed above - it's the same note). This will make it sound less
    like a dominant resolution, but you still get a lot of the same voice leading.
  - ... context is that this is really a big deal in "Someday", the reharm
    of "Someday My Prince Will Come", in which the Ebm7 often goes to the Gm7,
    but at other times instead it's a Gbma7#11 going to G.
- There are two ways of thinking how this chord connects with the others outlined:
  - The bVI minor 7 (or minor 13 really) is almost the same as VIImaj7#11,
    as noted in the "Someday" example above
  - In addition, it's interesting to compare
    - bVIma7b5 is just an inversion of a V phrygian (with the natural 5 of the V)
      with the 7 of the V chord omitted (if you add a 6 then it's the full thing)
    - bVIma7 is an inversion of a V phrygian with a #5 (so more altered),
      again with the 7 of the V cord omitted (again, you can add a 6)
    - bVImi6 is an inversion of V altered; it's relationship to bVIma6 is the same
      as Phrygian vs altered dominant: a suspended -> regular dominant sound.
